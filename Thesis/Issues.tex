\chapter{Issues to be solved}
	
	- The issue of linearity: Work on this. There is F0 and F1. F0 is the non-linear component. F1 is linear (in very simple terms.)
	- So depending on the process we are looking at, we would have to figure out what the response is.
	- But orientation tuning has both linear and non linear processes.
	- Tasks for the next couple of days: linear and non linear processes in orientation tuning. This will help us define what responses we are looking at.
