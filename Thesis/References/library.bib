abstract = {We explore the extent to which neocortical circuits generalize, i.e., to what extent can neocortical neurons and the circuits they form be considered as canonical? We find that, as has long been suspected by cortical neuroanatomists, the same basic laminar and tangential organization of the excitatory neurons of the neocortex is evident wherever it has been sought. Similarly, the inhibitory neurons show characteristic morphology and patterns of connections throughout the neocortex. We offer a simple model of cortical processing that is consistent with the major features of cortical circuits: The superficial layer neurons within local patches of cortex, and within areas, cooperate to explore all possible interpretations of different cortical input and cooperatively select an interpretation consistent with their various cortical and subcortical inputs.},

abstract = {Studies of visual processing in rodents have conventionally been performed on anesthetized animals, precluding examination of the effects of behavior on visually evoked responses. We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate powerful cell-type-specific modulation of visual processing by behavioral state in awake mice.},

In other words, the set of object descriptions that permit identification and recognition may be computed independently of the set of descriptions that allow an observer to shape the hand appropriately to pick up an object. We propose that the ventral stream of projections from the striate cortex to the inferotemporal cortex plays the major role in the perceptual identification of objects, while the dorsal stream projecting from the striate cortex to the posterior parietal region mediates the required sensorimotor transformations for visually guided actions directed at such objects.},

@article{Gardner1999,
abstract = {Orientation selectivity is one of the most conspicuous receptive-field (RF) properties that distinguishes neurons in the striate cortex from those in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). It has been suggested that orientation selectivity arises from an elongated array of feedforward LGN inputs (Hubel {\&} Wiesel, 1962). Others have argued that cortical mechanisms underlie orientation selectivity (e.g. Sillito, 1975; Somers et al., 1995). However, isolation of each mechanism is experimentally difficult and no single study has analyzed both processes simultaneously to address their relative roles. An alternative approach, which we have employed in this study, is to examine the relative contributions of linear and nonlinear mechanisms in sharpening orientation tuning. Since the input stage of simple cells is remarkably linear, the nonlinear contribution can be attributed solely to cortical factors. Therefore, if the nonlinear component is substantial compared to the linear contribution, it can be concluded that cortical factors play a prominent role in sharpening orientation tuning. To obtain the linear contribution, we first measure RF profiles of simple cells in the cat's striate cortex using a binary m-sequence noise stimulus. Then, based on linear spatial summation of the RF profile, we obtain a predicted orientation-tuning curve, which represents the linear contribution. The nonlinear contribution is estimated as the difference between the predicted tuning curve and that measured with drifting sinusoidal gratings. We find that measured tuning curves are generally more sharply tuned for orientation than predicted curves, which indicates that the linear mechanism is not enough to account for the sharpness of orientation-tuning. Therefore, cortical factors must play an important role in sharpening orientation tuning of simple cells. We also examine the relationship of RF shape (subregion aspect ratio) and size (subregion length and width) to orientation-tuning halfwidth. As expected, predicted tuning halfwidths are found to depend strongly on both subregion length and subregion aspect ratio. However, we find that measured tuning halfwidths show only a weak correlation with subregion aspect ratio, and no significant correlation with RF length and width. These results suggest that cortical mechanisms not only serve to sharpen orientation tuning, but also serve to make orientation tuning less dependent on the size and shape of the RF. This ensures that orientation is represented equally well regardless of RF size and shape.},

In particular, attention is drawn to those processes involved in exercising control over behavior as drug dependence is characterized by risky, impulsive behavior. Functional neuroimaging implicates prefrontal deficits in cocaine dependence with an emerging picture of cocaine users having attentional biases towards drug-related stimuli, poor performance in laboratory tests of inhibitory control, and compromised monitoring and evaluation of their behavior. Combined, these deficits may contribute to the continuation of use in dependent individuals and may qualify as important targets for therapeutic interventions.},

@article{Sasaki2006,
abstract = {It is generally assumed that sensitivity to different stimulus orientations is mapped in a globally equivalent fashion across primate visual cortex, at a spatial scale larger than that of orientation columns. However, some evidence predicts instead that radial orientations should produce higher activity than other orientations, throughout visual cortex. Here, this radial orientation bias was robustly confirmed using (1) human psychophysics, plus fMRI in (2) humans and (3) behaving monkeys. In visual cortex, fMRI activity was at least 20{\%} higher in the retinotopic representations of polar angle which corresponded to the radial stimulus orientations (relative to tangential). In a global demonstration of this, we activated complementary retinotopic quadrants of visual cortex by simply changing stimulus orientation, without changing stimulus location in the visual field. This evidence reveals a neural link between orientation sensitivity and the cortical retinotopy, which have previously been considered independent.},

@article{Levick1982c,
abstract = {1. Responses of cat retinal ganglion cells to a drifting sinusoidal grating stimulus were measured as a function of the grating orientation and spatial frequency.2. The response at fixed frequency and contrast varied with orientation in the manner of a cosine function. A new measure was introduced to quantify this orientation bias in the response domain on an absolute scale of 0-100{\%}. Under experimental conditions designed to maximize the effect, the mean bias for 250 cells was 16{\%} and the range was 0-46{\%}. In 70{\%} of cells there was significant bias.3. Orientation bias varied with spatial frequency and was maximal near the high-frequency limit. The majority of biassed cells preferred the same orientation at high and low frequencies but in some cells a reversal occurred: the orientation which gave maximum response at high frequencies gave minimum response at low frequencies. The greatest variation of cut-off frequency with orientation was (2/3) octave.4. Orientation bias was due to neural, not optical, factors. Nevertheless, the phenomenon could often be imitated by deliberately introduced optical astigmatism of up to 4 dioptres for brisk-sustained units and over 10 dioptres for brisk-transient units.5. The grating orientation preferred by cells varied systematically with position in the visual field. The central tendency was for the grating which yielded maximum response to lie parallel to the line joining the cell to the area centralis. This generalization failed for units within 2 degrees of the centre of the area centralis.6. Analysis of orientation bias indicates a functional asymmetry of receptive fields such that the centre mechanism, and sometimes also the surround mechanism, is elongated along the line joining cell to area centralis.},

abstract = {We measured the spatial-frequency tuning of cells at regular intervals along tangential probes through the monkey striate cortex and correlated the recording sites with the cortical cytochrome oxidase (CytOx) patterns to address three questions with regard to the cortical spatial-frequency organization. (i) Is there a periodic anatomical arrangement of cells tuned to different spatial-frequency ranges? We found there is, because the spatial-frequency tuning of cells along tangential probes changed systematically, varying from a low frequency to a middle range to high frequencies and back again repeatedly over distances of about 0.6-0.7 mm. (ii) Are there just two populations of cells, low-frequency and high-frequency units, at a given eccentricity (perhaps corresponding to the magno- and parvocellular geniculate pathways) or is there a continuum of spatial-frequency peaks? We found a continuum of peak tuning. Most cells are tuned to intermediate spatial frequencies and form a unimodal rather than a bimodal distribution of cell peaks. Furthermore, the cells with different peak frequencies were found to be continuously and smoothly distributed across a module. (iii) What is the relation between the physiological spatial-frequency organization and the regions of high CytOx concentration ("blobs")? We found a systematic correlation between the topographical variation in spatial-frequency tuning and the modular CytOx pattern, which also varied continuously in density. Low-frequency cells are at the center of the blobs, and cells tuned to increasingly higher spatial frequencies are at increasing radial distances.},

abstract = {The contribution and precise role of intracortical circuits in generating orientation tuned responses in visual cortical neurons is still controversial. To address this question, the relationship between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections and orientation maps in ferret striate cortex was investigated by combining in vivo optical imaging and in vitro scanning laser photostimulation. Excitatory and inhibitory inputs to pyramidal cells originated preferentially from regions with similar orientation preference. Prominent cross-orientation inhibition was not observed, arguing against cross-orientation models of orientation selectivity. The tuning of inhibitory inputs was significantly broader in both layer 2/3 and layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons compared to the tuning of excitatory inputs. Local excitatory inputs were more prominent in the 0-20 degrees tuning difference range between pre- and postsynaptic cells than inhibitory inputs, whereas inhibition dominated in the 20-40 degrees tuning difference range. These differences in tuning of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto individual cells are consistent with the predictions of recurrent models of orientation selectivity.},

abstract = {The cortical control of eye movements is highly sophisticated. Not only can eye movements be made to the most salient target in a visual scene, but they can also be controlled by top-down rules as is required for visual search or reading. The cortical area called frontal eye fields (FEF) has been shown to play a key role in the visual to oculomotor transformations in tasks requiring an eye movement pattern that is not completely reactive, but follows a previously learned rule. The layered, local cortical circuit, which provides the anatomical substrate for all cortical computation, has been studied extensively in primary sensory cortex. These studies led to the concept of a "canonical circuit" for neocortex (Douglas et al., 1989; Douglas and Martin, 1991), which proposes that all areas of neocortex share a common basic circuit. However, it has not ever been explored whether in principle the detailed canonical circuit derived from cat area 17 (Binzegger et al., 2004) could implement the quite different functions of prefrontal cortex. Here, we show that the canonical circuit can, with a few modifications, model the primate FEF. The spike-based network of integrate-and-fire neurons was tested in tasks that were used in electrophysiological experiments in behaving macaque monkeys. The dynamics of the model matched those of neurons observed in the FEF, and the behavioral results matched those observed in psychophysical experiments. The close relationship between the model and the cortical architecture allows a detailed comparison of the simulation results with physiological data and predicts details of the anatomical circuit of the FEF.},

abstract = {This intracellular study investigates synaptic mechanisms of orientation and direction selectivity in cat area 17. Visually evoked inhibition was analyzed in 88 cells by detecting spike suppression, hyperpolarization, and reduction of trial-to-trial variability of membrane potential. In 25 of these cells, inhibition visibility was enhanced by depolarization and spike inactivation and by direct measurement of synaptic conductances. We conclude that excitatory and inhibitory inputs share the tuning preference of spiking output in 60{\%} of cases, whereas inhibition is tuned to a different orientation in 40{\%} of cases. For this latter type of cells, conductance measurements showed that excitation shared either the preference of the spiking output or that of the inhibition. This diversity of input combinations may reflect inhomogeneities in functional intracortical connectivity regulated by correlation-based activity-dependent processes.},

abstract = {The response of a neuron in primary visual cortex {\{}(V1){\}} to an optimal stimulus in its classical receptive field {\{}(CRF){\}} can be reduced by the presence of an orthogonal mask, a phenomenon known as cross-orientation suppression. The presence of a parallel stimulus outside the {\{}CRF{\}} can have a similar effect, in this case known as surround suppression. We used a novel stimulus to probe the time course of cross-orientation suppression and found that it is very fast, starting even before the response to optimal excitatory stimuli. However, it occurs with some delay after the offset response, considered to be a measure of the earliest excitatory signals that reach the {\{}CRF.{\}} We also examined the time course of response to a stimulus presented outside the {\{}CRF{\}} and found that cross-orientation suppression begins substantially earlier than surround suppression measured in the same cells. Together, these findings suggest that cross-orientation suppression is attributable to either direct feedforward signal paths to V1 neurons or a circuit involving fast local interneurons within V1. Feedback from higher cortical areas is implicated in surround suppression, but our results make this an implausible mechanism for cross-orientation suppression. We conclude that suppression from inside and outside the {\{}CRF{\}} occur through different mechanisms.},

Some direction-selective cells showed delayed asymmetric inhibition, some showed a shifting excitatory time course across the receptive field, and some showed both. Both the direction of the spatial offset of the inhibition and the direction of the shift in excitatory response time course correlated with the cells' preferred directionality. The delayed asymmetric inhibition may contribute to the shifting response time course. The data suggest that asymmetric inhibition is the major determinant for directionality in these cells, though both mechanisms could contribute. Based on this physiology, a simple, single-cell model is proposed, consistent with the known anatomy of some direction-selective cells.},

All Y cells but few X cells exhibited a shift effect (modulated periphery effect). 5. In response to drifting sine wave gratings of different spatial frequencies, X cells preferred higher spatial frequencies and showed smaller peak contrast sensitivities and somewhat narrower tuning curves than Y cells. 6. In response to a sine wave grafting of optimal spatial frequency drifting at different velocities, X and Y cells had similar temporal tuning curves. However, Y cells, largely because they preferred lower spatial frequencies, preferred higher drift velocities than X cells. 7. Our data suggest that X and Y cells can be differentiated objectively on the basis of a number of discharge parameters.

In this study we introduce a higher resolution optical imaging system that offers spatial and temporal resolution exceeding that achieved by most alternative imaging techniques for imaging cortical functional architecture or for monitoring local changes in cerebral blood volume or oxygen saturation. In addition, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for the activity-dependent intrinsic signals evoked by sensory stimuli, and studied their origins and wavelength dependence. These studies enabled high-resolution visualization of cortical functional architecture at wavelengths ranging from 480 to 940 nm. With the use of near-infrared illumination it was possible to image cortical functional architecture through the intact dura or even through a thinned skull. In addition, the same imaging technique proved useful for imaging and discriminating sensory-evoked, activity-dependent changes in local blood volume and oxygen saturation (oxygen delivery). Illumination at 570 nm allowed imaging of activity-dependent blood volume increases, whereas at 600-630 nm, the predominant signal probably originated from activity-dependent oxygen delivery from capillaries. The onset of oxygen delivery started prior to the blood volume increase. Thus, optical imaging based on intrinsic signals is a minimally invasive procedure for monitoring short- and long-term changes in cerebral activity.},

Some cells were strongly biassed for both stimuli, some were not biassed for either while still others were strongly biassed for only one or other stimulus. The preferred orientations for the two types of grating tended to be the same, on average, but substantial differences were not uncommon. A systematic preference for radially-oriented gratings was evident when the stimulus was drifting but there was an additional preference for tangentially-oriented gratings when the stimulus was alternating. Orientation bias for drifting gratings often extended over a broad range of spatial frequencies and was maximum near the resolution limit. For alternating gratings, bias was evident only at the highest spatial frequencies. Results indicate that the arrangement of receptive field components responsible for linear and nonlinear kinds of behaviour may sometimes possess different axes of symmetry.},

The neural mechanism underlying this cross-orientation suppression (COS) may arise from intracortical or subcortical processes or from both. Recent studies of the temporal frequency and adaptation properties of COS suggest that depression at thalamo-cortical synapses may be the principal mechanism. To examine the possible role of synaptic depression in relation to COS, we measured the recovery time course of COS. We find it too rapid to be explained by synaptic depression. We also studied potential subcortical processes by measuring single cell contrast response functions for a population of LGN neurons. In general, contrast saturation is a consistent property of LGN neurons. Combined with rectifying nonlinearities in the LGN and spike threshold nonlinearities in visual cortex, contrast saturation in the LGN can account for most of the COS that is observed in the visual cortex.},

In this review article, the different changes are examined in detail. Computed tomography studies have reported changes of frontal lobe in alcoholism, while magnetic resonance imaging studies supported these findings. Neurophysiological studies with positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography have reported a decreased frontal lobe glucose utilization and reduced cerebral blood flow. There is also evidence from neuropsychological studies that there are specific deficits in alcoholism that suggest frontal lobe dysfunction. Considered together, these studies lend a strong credence to the concept of frontal lobe pathology in alcoholism. However, frontal lobe is not an isolated part of the brain and should be considered with its heavy connections to different cortical and subcortical areas of the brain.},

We affirm that the generation of stimulation-evoked behaviour is based primarily on the orthodromic conduction of signals originating mainly from the deepest layers of cortex, while the work of Histed et al. is effectively limited to investigating the antidromic activation of lateral projection neurons of the superficial cortex. The apparent sparse activation is a consequence of the pattern of axonal projections based on activating a volume of axons while imaging cell bodies transecting a single plane through the cortex. This creates the false impression that the distribution of activated neurons is sparse and nonfocal. We recommend how two-photon calcium imaging, which is superb for the study of individual and groups of neurons, might be more effectively used to ascertain how electrical stimulation affects the brains of mammals. This is a timely topic since investigators are using electrical microstimulation in animals to develop prosthetic devices to restore sensory and motor functions in disabled patients.},

abstract = {Golgi and axonal transport techniques have been used to examine the organization of neurons within primary visual cortex, area 17, of the cat. This organization has been compared to that of the primate cortical area 17 as described in previous studies and it is discussed in relationship to the distribution of afferents from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The visual cortex of the cat and monkey show strong similarities in the laminar positions of neurons projecting extrinsically and also in the restriction of spiny stellate neurons to a central lamina (lamina 4) receiving input from the dLGN. However, lamina 4B in the monkey, which contains spiny stellate neurons but does not receive direct input from the dLGN, has no direct counterpart in cat area 17. Axon projections of spiny stellate neurons in the other divisions of lamina 4 differ in cat and monkey: the small, closely packed neurons in the lowermost division of lamina 4 (4B in the cat, 4Cbeta in the monkey) project chiefly within lamina 4 in the cat whereas in the monkey they have a strong projection to lamina 3. In the cat, spiny stellate neurons of lamina 4A project upon lamina 3 whereas in the monkey those in the apparently equivalent zone, 4Calpha, project upon lamina 4B. Most non-spiny stellate neurons examined have precisely organized interlaminar axonal projections which differ from the axon trajectories of neighboring spiny neurons.},

abstract = {Extrastriate areas TEO and V4 have been associated with form and color vision. Area V4 has also been suggested to participate in processes concerned with attention, stimulus salience, and perceptual learning. In a continuing effort to elucidate the connectional interactions and microcircuitry of these areas, we describe in this report the pattern of feedback connections from TEO and V4. Connections were demonstrated by injections of the high-resolution anterograde tracers PHA-L or biocytin and further analyzed by reconstruction of 25 individual axons through serial sections. This analysis yielded several new results: (1) Both areas TEO and V4 have widespread feedback connections (defined by their preferential termination in layer 1 and avoidance of layer 4). From TEO, there are dense projections to area V4 and moderate ones to V2 and V1. From V4, there are dense projections to V2 and moderate ones to V3 and V1. (2) Terminal fields span large territories in area V1, up to 6.0 mm in the case of axons originating from TEO; up to 5.0 mm in the case of axons originating from V4. In V2, fields tend to be smaller, between 3.0-5.0 mm. (3) Many axons from TEO and some from V4 have terminations in both areas V1 and V2. (4) Because individual terminal clusters and segments are often larger than cytochrome oxidase compartments, especially in V1, we suggest they may not be correlated with this compartmental organization. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that feedback connections may contribute to processes other than perceptual discrimination.},

However, most models of cortical development and processing do not reflect the anatomy and physiology of feedback excitation and are restricted to serial feedforward excitation. This report describes how populations of neurons in cat visual cortex can use excitatory feedback, characterized as an effective "network conductance", to amplify their feedforward input signals and demonstrates how neuronal discharge can be kept proportional to stimulus strength despite strong, recurrent connections that threaten to cause runaway excitation. These principles are incorporated into models of cortical direction and orientation selectivity that emphasize the basic design principles of cortical architectures.},

@article{Malach1993,
abstract = {In primate primary visual cortex, neurons sharing similar response properties are clustered together forming functional domains that appear as a mosaic of patches or bands, often traversing the entire cortical depth from the pia to the white matter. Similarly, each cortical site connects laterally through an extensive network of intrinsic projections that are organized in multiple clusters (patches) and reach distances of up to a few millimeters. The relationship between the functional domains and these laterally connected patches has remained a controversial issue despite intensive research efforts. To investigate this relationship, we obtained high-resolution functional maps of the cortical architecture by in vivo optical imaging. Subsequently, extracellular injections of the sensitive anterograde tracer biocytin were targeted into selected functional domains. Within the ocular dominance system, we found that long-range intrinsic connections tended to link the monocular regions of same-eye ocular dominance columns. Furthermore, we discovered that binocular domains formed a separate set of connections in area V1; binocular regions were selectively connected among themselves but were not connected to strictly monocular regions, suggesting that they constitute a distinct columnar system. In the other subsystem subserving orientation preference, patches of intrinsic connections tended to link domains sharing similar orientation preferences. Analyses of the precision of these connections indicated that in both functional subsystems, {\textless} 15{\%} of the connections were between domains having orthogonal response properties. However, their selectivity was limited; approximately 30{\%} +/- 10{\%} of the interconnected patches contained neurons exhibiting orientation tuning that differed from those found at the injection sites by at least 45 degrees. At short range (up to 400 microns from the injection site), this casual trend seemed markedly accentuated; the local, synaptic-rich axonal and dendritic arbors crossed freely through columns of diverse functional properties. These complex sets of connections can endow cortical neurons with a rich diversity of response properties and broad tuning.},

There is a bimodal distribution of direction-specific and nondirection-specific cells, with similar orientation tuning in each class. Cells range in orientation bandwidth at half amplitude from 6° to 360° (i.e. no orientation tuning), with a median near 40°. Fovealparafoveal and simple-complex subsamples show similar ranges of orientation bandwidths as well as similar medians (the bandwidths being somewhat broader than those found in cat cortex). The foveal subsample and a high-spatial-frequency subsample have more horizontal and vertical optimal orientations than oblique ones. Most cells show inhibition to some orientations, as well as excitation to others. Minimum-response orientations are generally less than 90° from the optimal orientation-indicating maximum inhibition adjacent to the excitatory orientations. Three simple receptive field models are shown to differ in their abilities to account for these results. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {It is well known that visual cortical neurons respond vigorously to a limited range of stimulus orientations, while their primary afferent inputs, neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), respond well to all orientations. Mechanisms based on intracortical inhibition and/or converging thalamocortical afferents have previously been suggested to underlie the generation of cortical orientation selectivity; however, these models conflict with experimental data. Here, a 1:4 scale model of a 1700 microns by 200 microms region of layer IV of cat primary visual cortex (area 17) is presented to demonstrate that local intracortical excitation may provide the dominant source of orientation-selective input. In agreement with experiment, model cortical cells exhibit sharp orientation selectivity despite receiving strong iso-orientation inhibition, weak cross-orientation inhibition, no shunting inhibition, and weakly tuned thalamocortical excitation. Sharp tuning is provided by recurrent cortical excitation. As this tuning signal arises from the same pool of neurons that it excites, orientation selectivity in the model is shown to be an emergent property of the cortical feedback circuitry. In the model, as in experiment, sharpness of orientation tuning is independent of stimulus contrast and persists with silencing of ON-type subfields. The model also provides a unified account of intracellular and extracellular inhibitory blockade experiments that had previously appeared to conflict over the role of inhibition. It is suggested that intracortical inhibition acts nonspecifically and indirectly to maintain the selectivity of individual neurons by balancing strong intracortical excitation at the columnar level.},

The receptive field scatter from the thalamic inputs was more limited than previously thought and matched the average receptive field size of neurons at the input layers of cortex. Moreover, the thalamic population receptive field (calculated as ON - OFF average) had separate ON and OFF subregions, similar to cortical neurons in layer 4, and provided an accurate prediction of the preferred orientation of the column. These results support developmental models of orientation maps that are based on the receptive field arrangement of ON and OFF visual inputs to cortex.},

abstract = {1. Receptive-field properties of neurons in the different layers of the visual cortex of normal adult cats were analyzed quantitatively. Neurons were classified into one of two groups: 1) S-cells, which have discrete on- and/or off-regions in their receptive fields and possess inhibitory side bands; 2) C-cells, which do not have discrete on- and off-regions in their receptive fields but display an on-off response to flashing stimuli. Neurons of this type rarely display side-band inhibition. 2. As a group, S-cells display lower relative degrees of binocularity and are more selective for stimulus orientation than C-cells. In addition, within a given lamina the S-cells have smaller receptive fields, lower cutoff velocities, lower peak responses to visual stimulation, and lower spontaneous activity than do the C-cells. 3. S-cells in all layers of the cortex display similar orientation sensitivities, mean spontaneous discharge rates, peak response to visual stimulation, and degrees of binocularity. 4. Many of the receptive-field properties of cortical cells vary with laminar location. Receptive-field sizes and cutoff velocities of S-cells and of C-cells are greater in layers V and VI than in layers II-IV. For S-cells, preferred velocities are also greater in layers V and VI than in layers II-IV. Furthermore, C-cells in layers V and VI display high mean spontaneous discharge rates, weak orientation preferences, high relative degrees of binocularity, and higher peak responses to visual stimulation when compared to C-cells in layers II and III. 5. The receptive-field properties of cells in layers V-VI of the striate cortex suggest that most neurons that have their somata in these laminae receive afferents from LGNd Y-cells. Hence, our results suggest that afferents from LGNd Y-cells may play a major part in the cortical control of subcortical visual functions.},

Because only a small fraction of V1 neurons projects to MT, we wished to establish the processing hierarchy more precisely by studying the properties of those neurons projecting to MT, identified by antidromic responses to electrical stimulation of MT. The neurons that project from V1 to MT were directionally selective and, like other V1 neurons, responded only to the motion of the components of complex patterns. The projection neurons were predominantly "special complex," responsive to a broad range of spatial and temporal frequencies, and sensitive to very low stimulus contrasts. The projection neurons thus comprise a homogeneous and highly specialized subset of V1 neurons, consistent with the notion that V1 acts as clearing house of basic visual measurements, distributing information appropriately to higher cortical areas for specialized analysis.},

abstract = {Visual perception critically depends on orientation-specific signals that arise early in visual processing. Humans show greater behavioral sensitivity to gratings with horizontal or vertical (0 degrees /90 degrees; 'cardinal') orientations than to other, 'oblique' orientations. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure an asymmetry in the responses of human primary visual cortex (V1) to oriented stimuli. We found that neural responses in V1 were larger for cardinal stimuli than for oblique (45 degrees /135 degrees ) stimuli. Thus the fMRI pattern in V1 closely resembled subjects' behavioral judgments; responses in V1 were greater for those orientations that yielded better perceptual performance.},

abstract = {The flash electroretinogram (ERG) represents a serial ensemble of neural responses that can be used to objectively evaluate retinal function on a layer-by-layer basis. In this review, the seminal concepts of Granit are developed within the modern context to demonstrate how the ERG waveform can be decomposed to isolate the activity of individual neural populations and their circuitry. The contribution of rods and cones to the ERG waveform can be precisely defined with simple methods that yield the veridical cone response, which allows identification of rod-isolated components. This knowledge will afford an enhanced capacity to understand retinal development and ageing as well as to interpret the effects of insult, genetic manipulation and disease processes on photoreceptor and neuron-specific components. This review integrates conclusions drawn from a large body of past work and presents new data that enables the provision of detailed methodology for ERG assessment in rodents. Emphasis is placed on protocols that allow efficient acquisition of useful information for the major ERG components with minimal complexity. In particular, specific guidelines for the isolation of rod and cone contributions from the full-field ERG in rodents are provided. This is complemented with detailed and novel methodology for determining parameters that describe individual neuronal generators of rod and cone responses. The effect of stimulus energy on the kinetics of ERG response recovery and photopigment bleaching and regeneration are also discussed. The guidelines presented here are applicable to a wide range of investigations of retinal disease in rodent models.},

abstract = {Masking is said to occur when a mask stimulus interferes with the visibility of a target (test) stimulus. One widely held view of this process supposes interactions between mask and test mechanisms (cross-channel masking), and explicit models (e.g., J. M. Foley, 1994) have proposed that the interactions are inhibitory. Unlike a within-channel model, where masking involves the combination of mask and test stimulus within a single mechanism, this cross-channel inhibitory model predicts that the mask should attenuate the perceived contrast of a test stimulus. Another possibility is that masking is due to an increase in noise, in which case, perception of contrast should be unaffected once the signal exceeds detection threshold. We use circular patches and annuli of sine-wave grating in contrast detection and contrast matching experiments to test these hypotheses and investigate interactions across spatial frequency, orientation, field position, and eye of origin. In both types of experiments we found substantial effects of masking that can occur over a factor of 3 in spatial frequency, 45 degrees in orientation, across different field positions and between different eyes. We found the effects to be greatest at the lowest test spatial frequency we used (0.46 c/deg), and when the mask and test differed in all four dimensions simultaneously. This is surprising in light of previous work where it was concluded that suppression from the surround was strictly monocular (C. Chubb, G. Sperling, {\&} J. A. Solomon, 1989). The results confirm that above detection threshold, cross-channel masking involves contrast suppression and not (purely) mask-induced noise. We conclude that cross-channel masking can be a powerful phenomenon, particularly at low test spatial frequencies and when mask and test are presented to different eyes.},

abstract = {Responses of simple and complex cells in cat striate cortex were studied with moving sine-wave gratings before and during application of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide. Both simple and complex cells exhibited a broadening of their spatial frequency tuning functions under bicuculline. This was especially evident at spatial frequencies lower than the ones the cell was responding to before the drug administration. The effects cannot be explained by response saturation and could be reversed by cessation of the iontophoresis. The results indicate that the band-pass response characteristics of the spatial frequency response functions of striate cells derive largely from intracortical inhibition. The findings have implications also for the orientation selectivity of cortical cells. Since many geniculate cells are tuned for stimulus orientation at higher spatial frequencies, suppression of the low-spatial-frequency component would remove some of the orientation non-specific response in striate cortical cells and contribute to their orientation selectivity.},

Sinusoidal gratings were used as stimuli and the variables of interest were orientation and contrast. Specifically, we wanted to determine if orientation tuning was dependent on contrast. Of 45 cells studied in detail, two basic types of contrast-response pattern were observed, but most patterns were intermediate between these extremes. In one type, responses increased approximately linearly with log contrast while in the second, saturation was found at low contrast levels. For all these cells, orientation tuning characteristics were independent of contrast. An additional observation, made from 14 cells, was that stimuli presented at non-optimal orientations can suppress responses to below the general maintained discharge levels. In eight of these cases, the inhibi-tion was clearly contrast-dependent.},

However, evidence from experiments on awake animals has shown that both eye movements and behavioral state can strongly modulate responses of neurons in visual cortex; the functional significance of this modulation, however, remains elusive. Using visual-flow feedback manipulations during locomotion in a virtual reality environment, we found that responses in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex are strongly driven by locomotion and by mismatch between actual and expected visual feedback. These data suggest that processing in visual cortex may be based on predictive coding strategies that use motor-related and visual input to detect mismatches between predicted and actual visual feedback.},

Although the receptive field (RF) of a visually responsive neuron is inherently a spatiotemporal entity, most studies have focused exclusively on spatial aspects of RF structure. Recently, however, the application of sophisticated RF-mapping techniques has enabled neurophysiologists to characterize RFs in the joint domain of space and time. Studies that use these techniques have revealed that neurons in the geniculostriate pathway exhibit striking RF dynamics. For a majority of cells, the spatial structure of the RF changes as a function of time; thus, these RFs can be characterized adequately only in the space-time domain. In this review, the spatiotemporal RF structure of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex is discussed.},

abstract = {Responses of a visual neuron to optimally oriented stimuli can be suppressed by a superposition of another grating with a different orientation. This effect is known as cross-orientation suppression. However, it is still not clear whether the effect is intracortical in origin or a reflection of subcortical processes. To address this issue, we measured spatiotemporal responses to a plaid pattern, a superposition of two gratings, as well as to individual component gratings (optimal and mask) using a subspace reverse-correlation method. Suppression for the plaid was evaluated by comparing the response to that for the optimal grating. For component stimuli, excitatory and negative responses were defined as responses more positive and negative, respectively, than that to a blank stimulus. The suppressive effect for plaids was observed in the vast majority of neurons. However, only approximately 30{\%} of neurons showed the negative response to mask-only gratings. The magnitudes of negative responses to mask-only stimuli were correlated with the degree of suppression for plaid stimuli. Comparing the latencies, we found that the suppression for the plaids starts at about the same time or slightly later than the response onset for the optimal grating and reaches its maximum at about the same time as the peak latency for the mask-only grating. Based on these results, we propose that in addition to the suppressive effect originating at the subcortical stage, delayed suppressive signals derived from the intracortical networks act on the neuron to generate cross-orientation suppression.},

Variations in the strength of the induced bias of direction and orientation were noted among the different subclasses of cortical neurons. Preferred velocities of cortical neurons did not appear matched to the velocity of stimuli in the rearing environment. The ocular dominance distribution among cortical neurons in the unidirectional cats was skewed toward the contralateral eye relative to normal cats. The distribution of preferred directions in collicular neurons was largely unaltered by the rearing procedures employed. As in normal cats, units in the left colliculus more frequently responded best to rightward stimulus movement while those in the right colliculus preferred leftward movement. The ocular dominance distribution among collicular units was somewhat skewed toward the contralateral eye.},

The CHS students completed assessments of drug-related memory associations, working memory capacity, and drug use. Control variables included age, gender, ethnicity, and acculturation. Robust multiple regression using least trimmed squares estimation indicated that there was a significant linear by linear interaction between working memory capacity (assessed with the self-ordered pointing task) and drug-related associations (assessed with verb generation and cue-behavior association tasks) in the prediction of alcohol and cigarette use. Consistent with dual-process cognitive theories, drug-related associations in memory predicted drug use more strongly in students with lower levels of working memory capacity.

Here we show that increasing both the spatial frequency and size of the grating stimuli beyond their respective optimal values strongly enhance the orientation tuning of LGN neurons. The resulting orientation tuning was clearly contrast-invariant. Furthermore, blocking intrathalamic inhibition by iontophoretically administering $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor antagonists, such as bicuculline and GABAzine, slightly but significantly weakened the contrast invariance. Our results suggest that orientation tuning in the LGN is caused by an elliptical classical receptive field and orientation-tuned surround suppression, and that its contrast invariance is ensured by local GABAA inhibition. This contrast-invariant orientation tuning in LGN neurons may contribute to the contrast-invariant orientation tuning seen in V1 neurons. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {For over three decades, the mechanism of orientation selectivity of visual cortical neurones has been hotly debated. While intracortical inhibition has been implicated as playing a vital role, it has been difficult to observe it clearly. On the basis of recent findings, we propose a model in which the visual cortex brings together a number of different mechanisms for generating orientation-selective responses. Orientation biases in the thalamo-cortical input fibres provide an initial weak selectivity either directly in the excitatory input or by acting via cortical interneurones. This weak selectivity of postsynaptic potentials is then amplified by voltage-sensitive conductances of the cell membrane and excitatory and inhibitory intracortical circuitry, resulting in the sharp tuning seen in the spike discharges of visual cortical cells.},

abstract = {Mechanisms supporting orientation selectivity of cat striate cortical cells were studied by stimulation with two superimposed sine-wave gratings of different orientations. One grating (base) generated a discharge of known amplitude which could be modified by the second grating (mask). Masks presented at nonoptimal orientations usually reduced the base-generated response, but the degree of reduction varied widely between cells. Cells with narrow orientation tuning tended to be more susceptible to mask presence than broadly tuned cells; similarly, simple cells generally showed more response reduction than did complex cells. The base and mask stimuli were drifted at different temporal frequencies which, in simple cells, permitted the identification of individual response components from each stimulus. This revealed that the reduction of the base response by the mask usually did not vary regularly with mask orientation, although response facilitation from the mask was orientation selective. In some sharply tuned simple cells, response reduction had clear local maxima near the limits of the cell's orientation-tuning function. Response reduction resulted from a nearly pure rightward shift of the response versus log contrast function. The lowest mask contrast yielding reduction was within 0.1-0.3 log unit of the lowest contrast effective for excitation. The temporal-frequency bandpass of the response-reduction mechanism resembled that of most cortical cells. The spatial-frequency bandpass was much broader than is typical for single cortical cells, spanning essentially the entire visual range of the cat. These findings are compatible with a model in which weak intrinsic orientation-selective excitation is enhanced in two stages: (1) control of threshold by nonorientation-selective inhibition that is continuously dependent on stimulus contrast; and (2) in the more narrowly tuned cells, orientation-selective inhibition that has local maxima serving to increase the slope of the orientation-tuning function.},

Experimental studies over the past year have highlighted the contribution of feedforward thalamo-cortical afferents, as proposed originally by Hubel and Wiesel, but they have also indicated that this contribution alone is insufficient to account for the sharp orientation tuning observed in the visual cortex. Recent advances in understanding the functional architecture of local cortical circuitry have led to new proposals for the involvement of intracortical recurrent excitation and inhibition in orientation selectivity. Establishing how these two mechanisms work together remains an important experimental and theoretical challenge. Addresses},

@article{Horton2005,
abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A "column" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term "column" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

In addition to subjective ratings of emotional experience provided by participants, their facial behavior was coded using an objective facial affect coding system; a content analysis also was applied to the emotion narratives. Separate repeated measures analyses of variance applied to each emotion domain indicated age differences in the co-occurrence of negative emotions and co-occurrence of positive and negative emotions across domains, thus extending the finding of emotion heterogeneity or complexity in emotion experience to facial behavior and verbal narratives. The authors also found that the inhibition condition resulted in a different pattern of results in the older versus middle-aged and younger adults. The intensity and frequency of discrete emotions were similar across age groups, with a few exceptions. Overall, the findings were generally consistent with differential emotions theory.},

High-resolution maps of these three subsystems were acquired. Optical imaging based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals revealed that the most prominent organizational feature of orientation preference was a radial arrangement, forming a pinwheel-like structure surrounding a singularity point. More than 80{\%} of these pinwheels were centered along the midline of ocular-dominance columns. The iso-orientation contours of adjacent pinwheels crossed borders of ocular-dominance columns at approximately right angles. Pinwheels with the same or opposite directions of orientation-preference change were smoothly connected with each other. On the average, all orientations were equally represented. In exactly the same cortical area, the cytochrome oxidase blobs, thought to be involved in color processing, were also mapped, using cytochrome oxidase histology. Like the centers of pinwheels, the centers of blobs also lie along the midline of ocular-dominance columns. However, the centers of pinwheels did not coincide with the centers of blobs; these two subsystems are spatially independent. "Hypercolumn" modules, each including two complete pinwheels in two adjacent columns of complementary ocularity, as well as portions of a few blobs, were frequently found but did not seem to be the primary unit of cortical organization. An alternative to hypercolumns is proposed.},

This recurrent activity might underlie such diverse operations as short-term memory4, 6, 7, the modulation of neuronal excitability with attention8, 9, and the generation of spontaneous activity during sleep5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Here we show that local cortical circuits do indeed operate through a proportional balance of excitation and inhibition generated through local recurrent connections, and that the operation of such circuits can generate self-sustaining activity that can be turned on and off by synaptic inputs. These results confirm the long-hypothesized role of recurrent activity as a basic operation of the cerebral cortex.},

We recorded from individual neurons in ferret primary visual cortex to determine the influence of stimulus contrast on orientation tuning, temporal-frequency tuning, and latency to visual response. Results show that orientation-tuning bandwidth is not affected by contrast level. Thus neurons in ferret visual cortex display contrast-invariant orientation tuning. Stimulus contrast does, however, influence the structure of orientation-tuning curves as measures of circular variance vary inversely with contrast for both simple and complex cells. This change in circular variance depends, in part, on a contrast-dependent change in the ratio of null to preferred orientation responses. Stimulus contrast also has an influence on the temporal-frequency tuning of cortical neurons. Both simple and complex cells display a contrast-dependent rightward shift in their temporal frequency-tuning curves that results in an increase in the highest temporal frequency needed to produce a half-maximum response (TF(50)). Results show that the degree of the contrast-dependent increase in TF(50) is similar for cortical neurons and neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and indicate that subcortical mechanisms likely play a major role in establishing the degree of effect displayed by downstream neurons. Finally, results show that LGN and cortical neurons experience a contrast-dependent phase advance in their visual response. This phase advance is most pronounced for cortical neurons indicating a role for both subcortical and cortical mechanisms.},

Frequency response functions for most cells were unimodal and skewed towards zero frequency when plotted on linear scales. At a fixed retinal location, cells of different classes had different frequency response functions. Heterogeneity within some of the classes could be largely removed by normalizing the axes, thus, revealing a common shape of function for the class. At a fixed retinal location, the maximum response obtained at each spatial frequency was always obtained from a cell of the brisk, rather than sluggish, classes. Spatial frequency resolution was highest for brisk-sustained cells and usually lowest for brisk transient cells.},

This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2-4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional streams.},

abstract = {For over a century, electrical microstimulation has been the most direct method for causally linking brain function with behavior. Despite this long history, it is still unclear how the activity of neural populations is affected by stimulation. For example, there is still no consensus on where activated cells lie or on the extent to which neural processes such as passing axons near the electrode are also activated. Past studies of this question have proven difficult because microstimulation interferes with electrophysiological recordings, which in any case provide only coarse information about the location of activated cells. We used two-photon calcium imaging, an optical method, to circumvent these hurdles. We found that microstimulation sparsely activates neurons around the electrode, sometimes as far as millimeters away, even at low currents. Our results indicate that the pattern of activated neurons likely arises from the direct activation of axons in a volume tens of microns in diameter.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to explore the functional organization of direction of motion in cat area 18. Optical imaging was used to record the activity of populations of neurons. We found a patchy distribution of cortical regions exhibiting preference for one direction over the opposite direction of motion. The degree of clustering according to preference of direction was two to four times smaller than that observed for orientation. In general, direction preference changed smoothly along the cortical surface; however, discontinuities in the direction maps were observed. These discontinuities formed lines that separated pairs of patches with preference for opposite directions. The functional maps for direction and for orientation preference were closely related; typically, an iso-orientation patch was divided into regions that exhibited preference for opposite directions, orthogonal to the orientation. In addition, the lines of discontinuity within the direction map often connected points of singularity in the orientation map. Although the organization of both domains was related, the direction and the orientation selective responses were separable; whereas the selective response according to direction of motion was nearly independent of the length of bars used for visual stimulation, the selective response to orientation decreased significantly with decreasing length of the bars. Extensive single and multiunit electrical recordings, targeted to selected domains of the functional maps, confirmed the features revealed by optical imaging. We conclude that significant processing of direction of motion is performed early in the cat visual pathway.},

As a result, V1 has become an area of choice for studying cortical computation and its underlying mechanisms. Here we consider the receptive field properties of the simple cells in cat V1-the cells that receive direct input from thalamic relay cells-and explore how these properties, many of which are highly nonlinear, arise. We have found that many receptive field properties of V1 simple cells fall directly out of Hubel and Wiesel@s feedforward model when the model incorporates realistic neuronal and synaptic mechanisms, including threshold, synaptic depression, response variability, and the membrane time constant.},

This observation raises the question of whether this variability originates from within the cortical circuit or the feedforward inputs from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). To distinguish between these two sources of variability, we first measured membrane potential responses while inactivating the surrounding cortex, and found that response variability was nearly unaffected. We then studied variability in the LGN, including contrast dependence, and the trial-to-trial correlation in responses between nearby neurons. Variability decreased significantly with contrast, whereas correlation changed little. When these experimentally measured parameters of variability were applied to a feedforward model of simple cells that included realistic mechanisms of synaptic integration, contrast-dependent, orientation independent variability emerged in the membrane potential responses. Analogous mechanisms might contribute to the stimulus dependence and propagation of variability throughout the neocortex.},

One simplifying hypothesis that has existed since Cajal is that the neocortex consists of repeated copies of the same fundamental circuit. However, finding that fundamental circuit has proved elusive, although partial drafts of a "canonical circuit" appear in many different guises of structure and function. Here, we review some critical stages in the history of this quest. In doing so, we consider the style of cortical computation in relation to the neuronal machinery that supports it. We conclude that the structure and function of cortex honors two major computational principles: "just-enough" and "just-in-time."},

Siamese cats, and cat deprived of patterned visual experience from birth by monocular lid-suture (MD) were studied. Mathematical techniques designed to analyze direction were used to find the dendritic field orientation of each cell. Statistical techniques designed for angular data were used to determine the relationship between dendritic field orientation and angular position on the retina (polar angle). Our results indicate that 88{\%} of retinal ganglion cells have oriented dendritic fields and that dendritic field orientation is related systematically to retinal position. In all regions of retina more that 0.5 mm from the area centralis the dendritic fields of retinal ganglion cells are oriented radially, i.e., like the spokes of a wheel having the area centralis at its hub. This relationship was present in all animals and cell types studied and was strongest for cells located close to the horizontal meridian (visual streak) of the retina. Retinal ganglion cells appear to be sensitive to stimulus orientation because they have oriented dendritic fields.},

abstract = {The corticocortical pathway from striate cortex into the temporal lobe plays a crucial role in the visual recognition of objects. Anatomical studies indicate that this pathway is mainly organized as a serial hierarchy of multiple visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, V4, and inferior temporal cortex (IT). As expected from the anatomy, we have found that neurons in V4 and IT, like those in V1 and V2, are sensitive to many kinds of information relevant to object recognition. In the spatial domain, many V4 cells exhibit length, width, orientation, direction of motion and spatial frequency selectivity. In the spectral domain, many V4 cells are also tuned to wavelength. Thus, V4 is not specialized to analyze one particular attribute of a visual stimulus; rather, V4 appears to process both spatial and spectral information in parallel. A special contribution of V4 neurons to visual processing may lie in specific spatial and spectral interactions between their small excitatory receptive fields and large silent suppressive surrounds. Thus, although the excitatory receptive fields of V4 neurons are small, the responses of V4 neurons are influenced by stimuli throughout a much larger portion of the visual field. In IT, neurons also appear to process both spatial and spectral information throughout a large portion of the visual field. However, unlike V4 neurons, the excitatory receptive fields of IT neurons are very large. Many IT neurons, for example, are selective for the overall shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, anywhere within the central visual field. Together, these results suggest that within the areas of the occipito-temporal pathway, many different stimulus qualities are processed in parallel, but the type of analysis may become more global at each stage of processing.},

There is little doubt that each subfield is generated by excitatory input from geniculate neurons of the appropriate center type: ON subfields by ON-center cells, and OFF subfields by OFF-center cells. In intracellular records, ON subfields can be detected as regions in which light elicits a barrage of EPSPs, while in OFF subfields, turning a light off does the same. In addition, visual stimuli can evoke strong IPSPs, but these IPSPs have a receptive field spatially opponent to that of the EPSPs: Inhibition is evoked by turning a light off in an ON region and turning a light on in an OFF region. This inhibition probably arises from other cortical simple cells, and may contribute to such receptive-field properties as antagonism between subfields, binocular disparity sensitivity, and orientation selectivity.},

@article{Maunsell1992,
abstract = {1. Many lines of evidence suggest that signals relayed by the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the primate lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) maintain their segregation in cortical processing. We have examined two response properties of units in the striate cortex of macaque monkeys, latency and transience, with the goal of assessing whether they might be used to infer specific geniculate contributions. Recordings were made from 298 isolated units and 1,129 multiunit sites in the striate cortex in four monkeys. Excitotoxin lesions that selectively affected one or the other LGN subdivision were made in three animals to demonstrate directly the magnocellular and parvocellular contributions. An additional 435 single units and 551 multiunit sites were recorded after the ablations. 2. Most units in striate cortex had visual response latencies in the range of 30-50 ms under the stimulus conditions used. The earliest neuronal responses in striate cortex differed appreciably between individuals. The shortest latency recorded in the four animals ranged from 20 to 31 ms. Comparable values were obtained from both single unit and multiunit sites. After lesions were made in the magnocellular subdivision of the LGN in two animals, the shortest response latencies were 7 and 10 ms later than before the ablations. A larger lesion in the parvocellular subdivision of another animal produced no such shift. Thus it appears that the first 7-10 ms of cortical activation can be attributed to activation relayed by the magnocellular layers of the LGN. 3. The units with the shortest latencies were all found in layers 4C or 6 and their responses were among the most transient in striate cortex. Furthermore, their responses all showed a pronounced periodicity at a frequency of 50-100 Hz. This periodicity was stimulus locked, and the responses of all short-latency units oscillated in phase. 4. An index of response transience was computed for the units recorded in striate cortex. The distribution of this index was unimodal and gave no suggestion of distinct contributions from the geniculate subdivisions. Magnocellular and the parvocellular lesions affected the overall transience of responses in striate cortex. The changes, however, were very small; extremely transient responses and extremely sustained responses survived both types of lesions. 5. A characteristic profile was observed in the response latencies in superficial layers. Latencies appeared to increase monotonically from layer 4 toward the surface of cortex, with the most superficial neurons not becoming active until 15 ms after responses were observed in layer 4C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {We previously suggested that orientation-tuned surround suppression of responses of cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) is primarily caused by a decrease in geniculocortical input for the cell [Ozeki H, Sadakane O, Akasaki T, Naito T, Shimegi S, Sato H (2004) Relationship between excitation and inhibition underlying size tuning and contextual response modulation in the cat primary visual cortex. J Neurosci 24:1428-1438]. To further test this hypothesis, we compared the strength of orientation and spatial phase selectivity of surround suppression, and the spatial extent of the extraclassical receptive field (ECRF) between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and V1 neurons of anesthetized cats. Extraclassical surround suppression in the LGN was well tuned to orientation-contrast and relative spatial phase between the classical receptive field (CRF) and ECRF stimuli. Significant orientation-tuned surround suppression was observed in 72.6{\%} of the LGN neurons and the 66.7{\%} of the V1 neurons tested. The degree of orientation selectivity of ECRF in LGN was comparable to that in V1; however, the strength of the relative spatial phase selectivity of ECRF in LGN was higher than that previously reported for V1 [Akasaki T, Sato H, Yoshimura Y, Ozeki H, Shimegi S (2002) Suppressive effects of receptive field surround on neuronal activity in the cat primary visual cortex. Neurosci Res 43:207-220; DeAngelis GC, Freeman RD, Ohzawa I (1994) Length and width tuning of neurons in the cat's primary visual cortex. J Neurophysiol 71:347-374]. In 70{\%} of the LGN neurons that exhibited significant orientation-tuned extraclassical surround suppression, the effective orientation of the suppression varied according to a change in the orientation of CRF stimulus, while the remaining 30{\%} exhibited a fixed preferred orientation of the suppression regardless of the orientation of the CRF grating. These results suggest that the basic properties of surround suppression, such as orientation and spatial phase tuning, already exist in cat LGN and that a decrease of surround suppression in excitatory inputs from LGN by surround suppression is the primary cause of surround suppression in V1. Corticogeniculate feedback may further elaborate the properties of surround suppression in LGN. ?? 2007 IBRO.},

abstract = {Responses of most neurons in the primary visual cortex of mammals are markedly selective for stimulus orientation and their orientation tuning does not vary with changes in stimulus contrast. The basis of such contrast invariance of orientation tuning has been shown to be the higher variability in the response for low‐contrast stimuli. Neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which provides the major visual input to the cortex, have also been shown to have higher variability in their response to low‐contrast stimuli. Parallel studies have also long established mild degrees of orientation selectivity in LGN and retinal cells. In our study, we show that contrast invariance of orientation tuning is already present in the LGN. In addition, we show that the variability of spike responses of LGN neurons increases at lower stimulus contrasts, especially for non‐preferred orientations. We suggest that such contrast‐ and orientation‐sensitive variability not only explains the contrast invariance observed in the LGN but can also underlie the contrast‐invariant orientation tuning seen at the level of the primary visual cortex.

abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study the operational organization of the human brain, but the exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.},

abstract = {I. The spatial tuning of X and Y relay cells in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and the spatial tuning of perigeniculate interneurons were investigated with sinusoidal grating patterns, either drifting or undergoing contrast reversal. 2. The responses of geniculate relay cells were analyzed into fundamental and second harmonic components of the stimulus modulation frequency (or drift rate). The spatial tuning of each harmonic component was analyzed separately in terms of Rodieck's (28) two-mechanism model. 3. The spatial parameters for the fundamental response of ‘X-cells and the second harmonic responses of Y-cells were similar. The spatial parameters for the fundamental response of Y-cells were quite different. 4. The spatial tuning of LGN relay cells and their s potentials, presumptive extracellularly recorded synaptic potentials that reflect the retinal input to the LGN cells, were very similar. This implies that there is only a small amount of spatial reorganization of the retinal input in the LGN. 5. The visual responses of perigeniculate interneurons were variable. In some cases there was a significant fundamental response to drifting gratings of high spatial frequency, which implies that the interneurons must receive some X input. In most cases there was an elevation of the discharge rate in response to drifting gratings and second harmonic responses to contrast reversal of gratings or modulation of single bars in the receptive field of the interneuron.},

Therefore, some cells$\backslash$nshow a clear increase in slope of the orientation and$\backslash$nspatial frequency tuning functions with increasing$\backslash$ncontrast, whereas in others the slopes reach maximum$\backslash$nvalues at medium contrasts. Using receiver operating$\backslash$ncharacteristic analysis, we estimated the minimum$\backslash$norientation and spatial frequency differences that can$\backslash$nbe signaled reliably as a response change by an$\backslash$nindividual cell. This analysis shows that, on average,$\backslash$nthe discrimination of orientation or spatial frequency$\backslash$nimproves with contrast at low contrasts more than at$\backslash$nhigher contrasts. Using the optimal stimulus for each$\backslash$ncell, we estimated the contrast threshold of 48$\backslash$nneurons. Most cells had contrast thresholds below 5{\%}.$\backslash$nThresholds were only slightly higher for nonoptimal$\backslash$nstimuli. Therefore, increasing the contrast of$\backslash$nsinusoidal gratings above approximately 10{\%} will not$\backslash$nproduce large increases in the number of responding$\backslash$ncells. The observed effects of contrast on the response$\backslash$ncharacteristics of nonsaturating cortical cells do not$\backslash$nappear consistent with the psychophysical results.$\backslash$nCells that reach their maximum response at$\backslash$nlow-to-medium contrasts may account for the contrast$\backslash$nindependence of psychophysical orientation and spatial$\backslash$nfrequency discrimination thresholds at medium and high$\backslash$ncontrasts.},

abstract = {The neuropsychological basis of attentional set-shifting, task-set switching and stop-signal inhibition is reviewed through comparative studies of humans and experimental animals. Using human functional neuroimaging, plus neuropsychological investigation of patients with frontal damage quantified by structural magnetic resonance imaging, and through parallels with effects of specific lesions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum in rats and marmosets, it is possible to define both distinct and overlapping loci for tasks such as extra-dimensional shifting and reversal learning, stop-signal reaction time and task-set switching. Notably, most of the paradigms implicate a locus in the right PFC, specifically the right inferior frontal gyrus, possibly associated with processes of response inhibition. The neurochemical modulation of fronto-striatal circuitry in parallel with effects on task performance has been investigated using specific neuropharmacological agents in animals and by human psychopharmacological investigations, sometimes in conjunction with functional imaging. Evidence is provided for double dissociations of effects of manipulations of prefrontal cortical catecholamine and indoleamine (5-HT) systems that have considerable implications in the treatment of disorders such as Parkinson's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depression, as well as in theoretical notions of how 'fronto-executive' functions are subject to state-dependent influences, probably related to stress, arousal and motivation.},

abstract = {The topography of lateral excitatory and lateral inhibitory connections was studied in relation to orientation maps obtained in areas 17 and 18. Small iontophoretic injections of biocytin were delivered to the superficial layers in regions where orientation selectivity had been mapped using electrode recordings of single- and multi-unit activity from various cortical depths. Biocytin revealed extensive patchy axonal projections of up to 3.5 mm in both areas while labelled somata occurred chiefly at the injection site, indicating that the labelling was primarily anterograde. Two types of boutons could be clearly distinguished: (i) putative excitatory boutons either en passant or having a short stalk and (ii) inhibitory boutons which were invariably of the basket-type. Three-dimensional reconstructions of all labelled boutons showed that the excitatory and the inhibitory networks had a distinctively different relationship to orientation maps. The overall distribution of connections showed that 53-59{\%} of excitatory and 46-48{\%} of inhibitory connections were at iso-orientation, +/-30 degrees; oblique-orientation, +/-(30-60) degrees, was shown by 30{\%} of excitatory and 28-39{\%} of inhibitory connections; cross-orientation was shown by 11-17{\%} of excitatory and 15-24{\%} of inhibitory connections. Although excitatory patches occupied mainly iso-orientation locations, interpatch regions representing chiefly non-iso-orientations (oblique + cross orientation) were also innervated. There was considerable overlap between the excitatory and inhibitory network. Nonetheless, inhibitory connections were more common than excitatory connections with non-iso-orientation locations. There was no significant difference between the orientation topography of area 17 and area 18 projections. The results suggest that in general the lateral connectivity system is not orientation specific, but shows a moderate iso-orientation preference for excitation and an even weaker iso-orientation preference for inhibition. The broad orientation spectrum of lateral connections could provide the basis for mechanisms that requiring different orientations, as for example in detecting orientation discontinuities.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental principles of visual cortical organization is that neurons form a "map" in which neighboring cells have similar orientation preferences. Previous anatomical and imaging studies have shown that although the exact layouts of these orientation preference maps vary between individuals, features of iso-orientation domains such as width and spacing appear constant within a species. Using chronic optical imaging of intrinsic signals we now demonstrate that in ferret area 17 a larger proportion of cortical surface is dominated by responses to horizontal and vertical contours than to the two oblique orientations. This was true for all ferrets studied both during development and in adulthood. Interestingly, however, we found that the degree of the overrepresentation varied significantly between individual animals. In some young ferrets, responses to horizontal and vertical stimuli developed faster than responses to oblique stimuli, and a much larger percentage of the cortex responded preferentially to horizontal and vertical stimuli. In other individuals, responses to all stimuli developed at roughly the same rate, and there was relatively little overrepresentation of horizontal and vertical preferences.},

Two studies were designed to both eliminate methodological problems of earlier experiments and clarify theoretical ambiguities. This was achieved by having subjects hold a pen in their mouth in ways that either inhibited or facilitated the muscles typically associated with smiling without requiring subjects to pose in a smiling face. Study 1's results demonstrated the effectiveness of the procedure. Subjects reported more intense humor responses when cartoons were presented under facilitating conditions than under inhibiting conditions that precluded labeling of the facial expression in emotion categories. Study 2 served to further validate the methodology and to answer additional theoretical questions. The results replicated Study 1's findings and also showed that facial feedback operates on the affective but not on the cognitive component of the humor response. Finally, the results suggested that both inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms may have contributed to the observed affective responses.},

This has usually been taken to mean that they are approximately circular in form (see, for example, ref. 2). Hammond tested the circularity of the centre component of receptive fields by plotting a contour of isosensitivity to a small flashed spot. He concluded that centres were often ellipitical (average ratio of major to minor axis 1.23) and that more than 50{\%} of the recorded cells had the major axis oriented within /+- 20 degrees of the horizontal. Such data are important for discussions of the neurophysiological basis of the 'oblique effect' (reduced visibility for periodic grating patterns when oriented away from the vertical or horizontal) observed in psychophysical experiments on humans because subcortical units are often assumed to be orientationally unbiased. Orientation selectivity is a prominent attribute of visual cortical neurones so analysis has usually emphasized the distribution of orientation selectivity at that level. The results presented here redirect attention to the retinal level since they reveal a previously unsuspected systematic relation between orientation bias of ganglion cells and their location relative to the area centralis.},

abstract = {Single cells in the cat striate cortex are more selective for the spatial frequency of sinewave grating stimuli than are cells of the retina or lateral geniculate nucleus. We have explored the possibility that this enhancement of selectivity results from spatial-frequency-selective inhibition. Stimulation with two superimposed gratings, one to excite the cell and one to probe for inhibition, revealed spatial frequency-dependent response suppression in 74{\%} of the total population studied. Suppression was slightly more prevalent in simple cells (80{\%}) than in complex cells (68{\%}). In 93{\%} of the cases where suppression was found, its tuning was complementary to excitatory spatial frequency tuning, and the strongest suppression was usually found where the excitatory tuning function approached zero imp./sec. Characteristics of the phenomenon were independent of cortical layers. We conclude that organized inhibitory mechanisms serve to refine the spatial frequency bandpass of striate cortical cells. This provides evidence for another degree of nonlinearity in the organization of cortical receptive fields and supports the hypothesis that a fundamental function of the visual cortex is image dissection in the domain of spatial frequency. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

This review discusses neuronal excitability and effective current spread estimated by using three different methods: 1) single-cell recording, 2) behavioral methods, and 3) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The excitability properties of the stimulated elements in neocortex obtained using these methods were found to be comparable. These properties suggested that microstimulation activates the most excitable elements in cortex, that is, by and large the fibers of the pyramidal cells. Effective current spread within neocortex was found to be greater when measured with fMRI compared with measures based on single-cell recording or behavioral methods. The spread of activity based on behavioral methods is in close agreement with the spread based on the direct activation of neurons (as opposed to those activated synaptically). We argue that the greater activation with imaging is attributed to transynaptic spread, which includes subthreshold activation of sites connected to the site of stimulation. The definition of effective current spread therefore depends on the neural event being measured.},

abstract = {There is considerable controversy over the existence of orientation and direction sensitivity in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons. Claims for the existence of these properties often were based upon data from cells tested well beyond their peak spatial frequencies. The goals of the present study were to examine the degree of orientation and direction sensitivity of LGN cells when tested at their peak spatial and temporal frequencies and to compare the tuning properties of these subcortical neurons with those of visual cortex. For this investigation, we used conventional extracellular recording to study orientation and direction sensitivities of owl monkey LGN cells by stimulating cells with drifting sinusoidal gratings at peak temporal frequencies, peak or higher spatial frequencies, and moderate contrast. A total of 110 LGN cells (32 koniocellular cells, 34 magnocellular cells, and 44 parvocellular cells) with eccentricities ranging from 2.6 deg to 27.5 deg were examined. Using the peak spatial and temporal frequencies for each cell, 41.8{\%} of the LGN cells were found to be sensitive to orientation and 19.1{\%} were direction sensitive. The degree of bias for orientation and direction did not vary with eccentricity or with cell class. Orientation sensitivity did, however, increase, and in some cases orientation preferences changed, at higher spatial frequencies. Increasing spatial frequency had no consistent effect on direction sensitivity. Compared to cortical cell orientation tuning, the prevalence and strength of LGN cell orientation and direction sensitivity are weak. Nevertheless, the high percentage of LGN cells sensitive to orientation even at peak spatial and temporal frequencies reinforces the view that subcortical biases could, in combination with activity-dependent cortical mechanisms and/or cortical inhibitory mechanisms, account for the much narrower orientation and direction tuning seen in visual cortex.},

While intracortical inhibition has been implicated as playing a vital role, it has been difficult to observe it clearly. On the basis of recent findings, we propose a model in which the visual cortex brings together a number of different mechanisms for generating orientation-selective responses. Orientation biases in the thalamo-cortical input fibres provide an initial weak selectivity either directly in the excitatory input or by acting via cortical interneurones. This weak selectivity of postsynaptic potentials is then amplified by voltage-sensitive conductances of the cell membrane and excitatory and inhibitory intracortical circuitry, resulting in the sharp tuning seen in the spike discharges of visual cortical cells.},

abstract = {The design of a macroscope constructed with photography lenses is described and several applications are demonstrated. The macroscope incorporates epi-illumination, a 0.4 numerical aperture, and a 40 mm working distance for imaging wide fields in the range of 1.5-20 mm in diameter. At magnifications of 1X to 2.5X, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100-700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5-10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain. In these reflection measurements large artifacts from the surface blood vessels, which were observed with conventional lenses, were eliminated with the macroscope.},

abstract = {It takes a fraction of a second to recognize a person or an object even when seen under strikingly different conditions. How such a robust, high-level representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear. In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle. We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes. Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant, sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.},

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying the emergence of orientation selectivity in the visual cortex have been, and continue to be, the subjects of intense scrutiny. Orientation selectivity reflects a dramatic change in the representation of the visual world: Whereas afferent thalamic neurons are generally orientation insensitive, neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) are extremely sensitive to stimulus orientation. This profound change in the receptive field structure along the visual pathway has positioned V1 as a model system for studying the circuitry that underlies neural computations across the neocortex. The neocortex is characterized anatomically by the relative uniformity of its cir-cuitry despite its role in processing distinct signals from region to region. A combination of physiological, anatomical, and theoretical studies has shed some light on the circuitry components necessary for generating orienta-tion selectivity in V1. This targeted effort has led to critical insights, as well as controversies, concerning how neural circuits in the neocortex perform computations.},

abstract = {Light-evoked changes in pigment epithelial cell membrane potentials and retinal extracellular potassium ion concentration, [K+]0, were measured in an in vitro frog retina-pigment epithelium-choroid preparation. Light stimuli hyperpolarized the apical membrane of the pigment epithelium. Through an electrical shunt pathway connecting the apical and basal membranes, the basal membrane also hyperpolarized, but to a lesser degree than the apical membrane. This differential hyperpolariation of the two membranes increased the transepithelial potential (TEP). This increase in TEP was shown to be the major voltage source of the c-wave of the electroretinogram (ERG). Direct measurement of [K+]0 in the distal retina, made with K+-specific microelectrodes, showed a light-evoked decrease in [K+]0 having an identical time course to the apical hyperpolarization. There was a linear relationship between the light-evoked change in TEP and the logarithm of [K+]0. This exact relationship was also found when the apical membrane was perfused directly with solutions of varying [K+]0. The change in TEP associated with the ERC c-wave, therefore, was explained solely by the response of the pigment epithelium to the light-evoked decrease in [K+]0 in the distal retina.},

abstract = {In the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of monkeys, which has been shown to play a critical role in colour discrimination, there are neurons sensitive to a narrow range of hues and saturation. By contrast, neurons in the retina and the parvocellular layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus (pLGN) encode colours in a way that does not provide explicit representation of hue or saturation, and the process by which hue- and saturation-selectivity is elaborated remains unknown. We therefore tested the colour-selectivity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and compared it with those of pLGN and IT neurons. Quantitative analysis was performed using a standard set of colours, systematically distributed within the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage)-xy chromaticity diagram. Selectivity for hue and saturation was characterized by analysing response contours reflecting the overall distribution of responses across the chromaticity diagram. We found that the response contours of almost all pLGN neurons were linear and broadly tuned for hue. Many V1 neurons behaved similarly; nonetheless, a considerable number of V1 neurons had clearly curved response contours and were selective for a narrow range of hues or saturation. The relative frequencies of neurons exhibiting various selectivities for hue and saturation were remarkably similar in the V1 and IT cortex, but were clearly different in the pLGN. Thus, V1 apparently plays a very important role in the conversion of colour signals necessary for generating the elaborate colour selectivity observed in the IT cortex.},

abstract = {A stereotaxic brain atlas of the longtailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) is presented in a format suitable for use as a template atlas of the macaque brain. It includes most of the brain segmented to show the boundaries of landmark structures such that every point in the brain can be represented by a unique set of coordinates in three-dimensional space and ascribed unambiguously to one and only one primary structure. More than 400 structures are represented, including 360 volumetric structures, which constitute the substance of the brain, and 50 superficial features. To facilitate use with ventriculography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other noninvasive imaging techniques, the stereotaxic space is referenced to internal landmarks, viz., the anterior commissure and posterior commissure; the center of the anterior commissure at the midline is the origin of the stereotaxic axes. Reference of stereotaxis to this bicommissural space facilitates structural comparison with human brain atlases, which are commonly referenced to the biocommissural line. It also facilitates comparison of brains of different nonhuman primate species by providing a template brain against which to compare size and internal variability. Thirty-three coronal sections at 1-mm intervals from the spinomedullary junction to the rostral extreme of the caudate nucleus show most structures of the hindbrain, midbrain, and subcortical forebrain. Separately, four side views and 16 coronal sections show cortical structures. Structures are represented by outlines of their boundaries and labeled according to NeuroNames, a systematic English nomenclature of human and nonhuman primate neuroanatomy. Abbreviations are based on a protocol designed to facilitate cross-species comparisons. Instructions are provided for: (1) locating sites from the Template Atlas in the conventional stereotaxic space of an experimental animal, (2) locating sites identified by conventional stereotaxis in the Template Atlas, and (3) using the Template Atlas to collate, compare, and display image information (e.g., labeled cells, recording sites, stimulation sites, lesions) from multiple animals.},

Among the neurones that could be driven monosynaptically from the dLGN, there was a high representation of those with a preference for the primary orientations. This was particularly evident in the case of C (complex) cells. There was no such preponderance of primary orientations among the polysynaptically activated cells. It is proposed that the asymmetry of distribution seen among the first-order cells reflects the asymmetry seen subcortically in neurones that show orientation biases. It may be that the cortex elaborates a more uniform representation of orientations only at the higher ordinal levels.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine what contributions are made to the rat full-field electroretinogram (ERG) by ganglion cells (GCs). To that end, the ERG was assessed longitudinally following optic nerve transection (ONTx). Additional studies were conducted using intravitreal injections of pharmacologically active substances. The ERG was recorded simultaneously from both eyes of anaesthetized adult Brown-Norway rats (ketamine: xylazine: acepromazine, 55: 5: 1 mg kg(-1)) using custom silver chloride electrodes. Stimuli were brief, white xenon discharges delivered via a Ganzfeld under dark-adapted and light-adapted conditions (150 cd m(-2)). ERGs were obtained 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 weeks after ONTx (n = 8) or sham (n = 8) operations. ONTx reduced both positive and negative components of the scotopic threshold response (pSTR and nSTR). Scotopic ERG responses to brighter flashes, including a-waves, b-waves and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were unaffected by ONTx. ONTx reduced the photopic b-wave and OPs. TTX (6 microM) reduced the pSTR and nSTR, but not the scotopic a-wave, b-wave or OPs. TTX had dramatic effects on the photopic ERG, surpassing the effects of ONTx. TTX application 9 weeks post-ONTx had little additional effect on the STR. Inhibition of inner retinal responses using GABA (10 mM) or NMDA (0.8 mM) reduced the nSTR substantially. Similar results were obtained with antagonists of AMPA/KA ionotropic glutamate receptors 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (CNQX, 0.2 mM) or cis-2,3-piperidinedicarboxylic acid (PDA, 5 mm); however, both also reduced the scotopic b-wave by approximately 40 {\%}. By contrast, the NMDA receptor antagonist D(-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (D-AP7, 0.2 mM) had no effect alone, but the combination of D-AP7 and CNQX completely abolished the STR. The results of this study indicate that: (1) both pSTR and nSTR components in the rat depend directly upon intact GC responses, and that amacrine cell contributions to these components are relatively small; (2) scotopic ERG response components to brighter flashes receive little influence from GCs; (3) the rat photopic ERG also reflects GC signals and may serve as an additional useful test of GC function; (4) TTX had dramatic effects on the rat photopic ERG that were not attributable to GC currents, but rather to voltage-gated sodium currents in amacrine or interplexiform cells; (5) a small residual negative STR persisted after ONTx that was likely to be generated by graded responses of third-order retinal cells, most likely amacrine cells.},

abstract = {To understand the transmission of sensory signals in visual pathways we studied the morphology and central projection of ganglion cell populations in marmoset monkeys. Retinal ganglion cells were labeled by photofilling following injections of retrograde tracer in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), or by intracellular injection with neurobiotin. Ganglion cell morphology was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis. In addition to midget and parasol ganglion cells, this method distinguished three main clusters of wide-field cells that correspond to small bistratified, sparse, and broad thorny cells identified previously. The small bistratified and sparse cells occupy neighboring positions on the hierarchical (linkage distance) tree. These cell types are presumed to carry signals originating in short-wavelength sensitive (S or "blue") cones in the retina. The linkage distance from these putative S-cone pathway ganglion cells to other wide-field cells is similar to the linkage distance from midget cells to parasol cells, suggesting that S-cone cells form a distinct functional subgroup of ganglion cells. Small bistratified cells and large sparse cells were the most commonly labeled wide-field cells following LGN injections in koniocellular layer K3. This is consistent with physiological evidence that the role of this layer includes transmission of S-cone signals to the visual cortex. Other wide-field cell types were also labeled following injections including K3, and other koniocellular LGN layers; these cell types may correspond to "non-blue koniocellular" receptive fields recorded in physiological studies.},

abstract = {In simple cells of the cat primary visual cortex, null-oriented stimuli, which by themselves evoke no response, can completely suppress the spiking response to optimally oriented stimuli. This cross-orientation suppression has been interpreted as evidence for cross-orientation inhibition: synaptic inhibition among cortical cells with different preferred orientations. In intracellular recordings from simple cells, however, we found that cross-oriented stimuli suppressed, rather than enhanced, synaptic inhibition and, at the same time, suppressed synaptic excitation. Much of the suppression of excitation could be accounted for by the behavior of geniculate relay cells: contrast saturation and rectification in relay cell responses, when applied to a linear feed-forward model, predicted cross-orientation suppression of the modulation (F1) component of excitation evoked in simple cells. In addition, we found that the suppression of the spike output of simple cells was almost twice the suppression of their synaptic inputs. Thus, cross-orientation suppression, like orientation selectivity, is strongly amplified by threshold.},

We find that, as has long been suspected by cortical neuroanatomists, the same basic laminar and tangential organization of the excitatory neurons of the neocortex is evident wherever it has been sought. Similarly, the inhibitory neurons show characteristic morphology and patterns of connections throughout the neocortex. We offer a simple model of cortical processing that is consistent with the major features of cortical circuits: The superficial layer neurons within local patches of cortex, and within areas, cooperate to explore all possible interpretations of different cortical input and cooperatively select an interpretation consistent with their various cortical and subcortical inputs.},

@article{Murasugi1993,
abstract = {We have previously shown that perceptual judgements of motion direction are based in part on the activity of direction selective neurons in extrastriate visual area MT (Salzman et al., 1990, 1992). In those experiments, we applied low-amplitude microstimulation pulses (10 microA, 200 Hz) to clusters of MT neurons whose preferred directions were similar. The effect of microstimulation was to bias the monkeys' choices on a direction discrimination task toward the preferred direction of neurons at the stimulation site. The results suggest that microstimulation generated a directionally specific cortical signal by activating selectively neurons near the electrode tip. To test this notion more directly, we have now examined the behavioral effects of varying current amplitude, current frequency, and electrode position. In the majority of experiments, the directional bias in the monkeys' choices was reduced or eliminated as current amplitude increased to 80 microA. In addition, 80 microA stimulating pulses frequently impaired overall performance as measured by the percentage of correct responses. This decrement in performance indicated that 80 microA pulses introduced "noise" into the neural circuitry encoding motion direction, presumably by increasing current spread to activate a larger population of neurons representing all directions of motion. In contrast, increasing current frequency to 500 Hz (10 microA pulses) preserved the directional specificity of microstimulation effects. The precise position of the stimulating electrode also influenced the magnitude of microstimulation effects; in some cases, differences in position on the order of 100 microns determined whether an experiment yielded a very large effect or no effect at all. Thus, directionally specific activation of cortical circuitry within MT can be disrupted by increases in current spread or by small changes in electrode position. These observations suggest that the effects of low-amplitude microstimulation depend upon direct activation of a well-localized population of neurons.},

@article{Crook1997,
abstract = {1. Microiontophoresis of gamma-aminobutyric acid was used to reversibly inactivate small sites of defined orientation and direction specificity at a horizontal distance of 400-700 microns from single cells recorded in cat area 18. There was extensive or complete overlap between the receptive fields of cells at the recording and inactivation sites. A cell's directionality index [DI: 1 - (response to nonpreferred direction/response to preferred direction)], the response to the preferred direction, and orientation tuning width (measured at half the maximum response) were compared before and during inactivation of either iso-orientation sites (where the orientation preference was within 22.5 degrees) or cross-orientation sites (where it differed by 45-90 degrees). 2. During iso-orientation inactivation, 40 (73{\%}) of 55 cells showed a significant ({\textgreater} 0.20) change in DI; the mean change in DI for these cells was 0.59. An additional cell showed a marked increase in response to the preferred direction that did not result in a change in DI. With one exception, the effects occurred in the absence of a significant ({\textgreater} 25{\%}) change in orientation tuning width. 3. In most cases, the results were broadly predictable in the sense that iso-orientation inactivation predominantly affected a cell's response to the direction of motion of an optimally oriented bar that was closest to the preferred direction at the inactivation site: viz., a decrease in response to the preferred direction and an increase in response to the preferred or nonpreferred direction. 4. It is argued that the decreases in response were due to a reduction in the strength of intracortical iso-orientation excitatory connections made primarily between cells with similar direction preferences, whereas the increases in response involved a loss of iso-orientation inhibition. 5. In cases where remote inactivation caused an increase in response to the nonpreferred direction, comparable effects could be elicited when a mask left exposed only the excitatory subregion of the receptive field in S cells or the most responsive part of the excitatory discharge region in C cells. This implies extensive or complete spatial overlap between the profiles of excitation and inhibition in a cell's nonpreferred direction. 6. During cross-orientation inactivation, a significant change in DI was seen in only 14 (19{\%}) of 73 cells and, with one exception, these changes were accompanied by increases in response to non-optimal orientations and significant broadening of orientation tuning. The effects of cross-orientation inactivation on directionality were presumably due to the loss of cross-orientation inhibition, which contributes primarily to orientation tuning. 7. Inactivation of the same site could cause an increase in response to the nonpreferred direction in cells recorded at iso-orientation sites and an increase in response to nonoptimal orientations and broadening of orientation tuning in cells recorded at cross-orientation sites. This is consistent with the notion that a single inhibitory neuron can contribute to the directionality or orientation tuning of different target cells depending on their location in the orientation map. 8. The results provide evidence for a major contribution of intrinsic mechanisms to the orientation tuning and direction selectivity of cells in cat area 18. It is proposed that two different intracortical processes are involved in the enhancement of orientation and direction selectivity: 1) suppression of responses to nonoptimal orientations and directions as a result of cross-orientation inhibition and iso-orientation inhibition; and 2) facilitation of responses to optimal orientations/directions via iso-orientation excitatory connections.},

abstract = {Neurons in the visual cortex are selectively responsive to light or dark bars presented at particular orientations. On the basis of physiological data, this orientation selectivity is hypothesized as being due at least partially to intracortical inhibitory mechanisms. But this hypothesis has been challenged by intracellular recordings indicating that excitatory inputs themselves are orientation-selective, so inhibition may not contribute to the observed selectivity. Also, there is controversy about the presence of intracortical horizontal connections mediating inhibition for selectivity and about the theoretical validity of such inhibitory connections. Using cross-correlation analysis of the activities of two neurons recorded simultaneously, we find that inhibitory interactions exist between cells with somewhat different, but not orthogonal, orientation preferences. This suggests that intracortical horizontal inhibition operates between 'orientation columns' to sharpen the orientation tuning of cortical neurons.},

abstract = {To test theories of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1), we have done experiments to measure the dynamics of orientation tuning of single neurons in the V1 cortex of macaque monkeys. Based on our dynamics results, we propose that a V1 cell's orientation selectivity is generated mainly by both tuned enhancement and global suppression. Enhancement near the preferred orientation is probably caused by feed-forward input from LGN (plus amplification by cortical-cortical interaction). Global suppression could be supplied by cortical inhibition. Additionally, in about 1/3 of V1 neurons (usually the most sharply tuned) there is tuned suppression, centered near the cell's preferred orientation but broader than tuned enhancement. These mechanisms also can explain important features of steady-state selectivity in the V1 neuron population. Furthermore, similar neuronal mechanisms may be used generally throughout the cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {Purpose. To compare refraction and ocular biometry in European Caucasian children aged 6 to 7 years and 12 to 13 years, living in Sydney, Australia, and Northern Ireland. Methods. All children had a comprehensive eye examination, including cycloplegic (cyclopentolate 1{\%}) autorefraction and ocular biometry. Hyperopia was defined as a right spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of ≥+2.00 diopters (D), myopia as ≤-0.50 D, and astigmatism as a cylindrical error of ≥1.00 D. Results. The mean SER was similar at age 6 to 7 years (P = 0.9); however, at 12 to 13 years, children in Northern Ireland had a significantly less hyperopic mean SER (+0.66 D) than children in Sydney (+0.83 D, P = 0.008). The prevalence of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism was significantly greater in Northern Ireland than Sydney at both ages (all P {\textless} 0.03). The distribution of refraction was highly leptokurtic in both samples, but less so in Northern Ireland (kurtosis: 6-7 years of age, 7.2; 12-13 years of age, 5.9) than Sydney (kurtosis: 6-7 years of age, 15.0; 12-13 years of age, 19.5). Conclusions. European Caucasian children in Northern Ireland have a greater prevalence of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism when compared to children living in Sydney. Risk factors for myopia such as parental myopia, parental education, and educational standards do not appear to explain the differences. Further work on levels of near work and time spent outdoors is required.},

Although we know that their functional properties can arise from the convergence of thalamic inputs, intracortical circuits could also be involved in thalamocortical transformations of sensory information. We silenced intracortical excitatory circuits with optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex and compared visually evoked thalamocortical input with total excitation in the same layer 4 pyramidal neurons. We found that intracortical excitatory circuits preserved the orientation and direction tuning of thalamocortical excitation, with a linear amplification of thalamocortical signals of about threefold. The spatial receptive field of thalamocortical input was slightly elongated and was expanded by intracortical excitation in an approximately proportional manner. Thus, intracortical excitatory circuits faithfully reinforce the representation of thalamocortical information and may influence the size of the receptive field by recruiting additional inputs.},

abstract = {1. Receptive-field properties of 214 neurons from cat striate cortex were studied with particular emphasis on:  a) classification, b) field size, c) orientation selectivity, d) direction selectivity, e) speed selectivity, and f) ocular dominance. We studied receptive fields located throughtout the visual field, including the monocular segment, to determine how receptivefield properties changed with eccentricity in the visual field.2. We classified 98 cells as "simple," 80 as "complex," 21 as "hypercomplex," and 15 in other categories. The proportion of complex cells relative to simple cells increased monotonically with receptive-field eccenticity.3. Direction selectivity and preferred orientation did not measurably change with eccentricity. Through most of the binocular segment, this was also true for ocular dominance; however, at the edge of the binocular segment, there were more fields dominated by the contralateral eye.4. Cells had larger receptive fields, less orientation selectivity, and higher preferred speeds with increasing eccentricity. However, these changes were considerably more pronounced for complex than for simple cells.5. These data suggest that simple and complex cells analyze different aspects of a visual stimulus, and we provide a hypothesis which suggests that simple cells analyze input typically from one (or a few) geniculate neurons, while complex cells receive input from a larger region of geniculate neurons. On average, this region is invariant with eccentricity and, due to a changing magnification factor, complex fields increase in size with eccentricity much more than do simple cells. For complex cells, computations of this geniculate region transformed to cortical space provide a cortical extent equal to the spread of pyramidal cell basal dendrites.},

abstract = {From the analyses of our own and others' anatomical and physiological data for the macaque visual system, we arrive at a conclusion that three pathways can provide the V1 neuron with access to information from the visual field and affect its response. First, direct thalamic input can determine the size of the initial activating RF at high contrast. Second, lateral connections can enlarge the RF at low contrast by pooling information from larger regions of cortex that are otherwise ineffective when high contrast thalamic input is driving the cortical neuron. Thirdly, feedback from extrastriate cortex (possibly together with overlap or interdigitation of coactive lateral connectional fields within V1) can provide a large and stimulus specific surround modulatory field. The stimulus specificity of the interactions between the center and surround fields, may be due to the orderly, matching structure and different scales of intra-areal and feedback projection excitatory pathways. The observed activity changes of single recorded excitatory neurons could be a result of the relative weight of excitation on the excitatory neurons themselves and on local inhibitory interneurons that synapse on them. Inhibitory basket neurons, driven by the local excitatory neurons, could govern local interactions between cortical patches of different tuning properties, resulting in more distant changes in excitatory input in the laterally connected intra-areal neuronal pools.},

By alternately polarizing the cell with steady current injected through the recording electrode, IPSPs and EPSPs could be recorded and analyzed independently. Hyperpolarizing current suppressed IPSPs and enhanced EPSPs by moving the membrane potential toward the IPSP equilibrium potential. Depolarizing the cell toward the EPSP equilibrium potential enhanced IPSP. The responses to electrical stimulation of the LGN, where EPSPs and IPSPs could be distinguished easily by virtue of their characteristic latencies and shapes, were used to set the current injection to the appropriate level to view the two types of synaptic potential. EPSPs were found to be well oriented in that maximal depolarizing responses could be evoked at only one stimulus orientation; rotating the stimulus orientation in either direction produced a fall in the EPSP response. IPSPs were also well tuned to orientation, and invariably the preferred orientations of EPSPs and IPSPs in any one cell were identical. In addition, no systematic difference in the width of tuning of the two types of potential was seen. This result has been obtained from penetrations of over 30 cortical cells, including those with simple and complex receptive fields. It is concluded that orientation of cortical receptive fields is neither created nor sharpened by inhibition between neurons with different orientation preference. The function of inhibition evoked simultaneously with excitation by optimally oriented stimuli has yet to be determined, though it is likely to be the mechanism underlying other cortical receptive field properties, such as direction selectivity and end-stopping.},

However, we argue that because emotional responding is important for successful living, both global and specific emotional responses can be induced without awareness. The present research used quick and super-quick subliminal priming techniques, and cognitive, feelings, and behavioral measures, to test this hypothesis. Our results show that both global moods and specific emotions can be evoked without conscious awareness of their cause.},

abstract = {We developed a quantitative description of the circuits formed in cat area 17 by estimating the "weight" of the projections between different neuronal types. To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few "strong" but many "weak" excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron.},

A subset of neurons showed vigorous responses to visual stimuli for trials in which the monkey was directing its attention to the respective receptive field location. In trials where attention is directed elsewhere, responses to the same stimuli were significantly reduced. In some cells the early response component was not modulated by attention, but later components were affected by the locus of attention.

@article{Li2008,
abstract = {Orientation selectivity is an important emergent property of neurons in the primary visual cortex, and inhibition is thought to play an important role in establishing this selectivity. But the relationship between strength of inhibition and orientation selectivity is unclear. To investigate this relationship, we electrophoretically applied the inhibitory transmitter GABA and the GABAAantagonist bicuculline on the same individual area 17 neurons in anesthetized cats. Neurons were classified as weakly orientation-selective, moderately orientation-selective, or strongly orientation-selective, according to the values of an orientation bias index. Orientation bias, half-width of the tuning curve at half-height and an orientation-specificity index (orthogonal to optimal ratio) were compared with or without GABA and bicuculline administration. GABA improved orientation selectivity with the greatest effects on weakly orientation-selective cells, smaller effects on moderately orientation-selective cells, and minimal effects on strongly orientation-selective cells; bicuculline diminished orientation selectivity the most on moderately and strongly orientation-selective cells, with minimal effects on weakly orientation-selective cells. We also found that orientation selectivity correlated with the level of neurons' spontaneous activity. These results suggest that the degree of orientation selectivity of an area 17 neuron correlates with its endogenous inhibition strength, and that GABAergic inhibition can bi-directionally regulate orientation selectivity. This correlation indicates that GABA-mediated inhibition plays an important role in establishing sharp orientation selectivity of individual neurons. {\textcopyright} 2008 IBRO.},

abstract = {The effects of an inhibitor of GABA synthesis, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MP), and of the GABA antagonist bicuculline (BIC), on the direction and orientation sensitivity of visual cortical neurons were investigated using a computer-controlled stimulus presentation system. Intravenous administration of MP, which was usually more effective than if administered microelectrophoretically, induced a slight, but significant reduction in these properties of about half of the neurons tested. The effect of electrophoretic BIC was in the same direction but clearer than that of MP. In 71{\%} of the simple cells, direction sensitivity was virtually lost during administration of BIC while orientation sensitivity was never completely eliminated in any neuron tested. Simultaneous administration of both drugs (MP systemically, BIC electrophoretically) caused more complete modification of the sensitivities than single administration of each. In four out of thirteen neurons tested, orientation sensitivity was completely abolished. The excitatory receptive fields slightly increased in size and became virtually round. The response magnitude to the optimal stimulus was increased by each drug along and by both. The present results further support the hypothesis that intracortical inhibition plays a major if not an exclusive role for the orientation and direction sensitivity of cortical cells.},

abstract = {In the primary visual cortex (V1), the single-neuron response to a grating stimulus placed in the classical receptive field (CRF) is suppressed by a similar stimulus presented in the CRF surround. To assess the input mechanism underlying the surround suppression, we tested the effects of iontophoretically administered GABA(A)-receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (BMI), for the 46 V1 neurons in anesthetized cats. First, the stimulus-size tuning curves were studied, with or without BMI administration, for each neuron by changing the size of the grating patch. During the BMI administration, the shape of the normalized size tuning curve did not change considerably. Second, the dependency of surround suppression on the orientation of the surround grating was examined. In the control, the surround suppression showed the clear orientation tuning that peaked at an orientation the same as the optimal orientation of the CRF response. The BMI administration did not change the orientation dependency of surround suppression. We also estimated the relative contribution of excitation and inhibition to the size and orientation tuning of surround suppression. It was concluded that cortical excitation and inhibition were well balanced, having similar tuning profiles for both stimulus size and orientation of the surround grating. Furthermore, surround stimuli used for V1 neurons suppressed the CRF response of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. These results suggest that surround suppression is not primarily attributable to the intracortical inhibition, but because of a reduction of thalamocortical inputs, which drive the cortical excitation and inhibition, and a subsequent decrease in the cortical excitatory interactions.},

abstract = {We develop a new analysis of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input to a cortical simple cell, demonstrating that this input is the sum of two terms, a linear term and a nonlinear term. In response to a drifting grating, the linear term represents the temporal modulation of input, and the nonlinear term represents the mean input. The nonlinear term, which grows with stimulus contrast, has been neglected in many previous models of simple cell response. We then analyze two scenarios by which contrast-invariance of orientation tuning may arise. In the first scenario, at larger contrasts, the nonlinear part of the LGN input, in combination with strong push-pull inhibition, counteracts the nonlinear effects of cortical spike threshold, giving the result that orientation tuning scales with contrast. In the second scenario, at low contrasts, the nonlinear component of LGN input is negligible, and noise smooths the nonlinearity of spike threshold so that the input-output function approximates a power-law function. These scenarios can be combined to yield contrast-invariant tuning over the full range of stimulus contrast. The model clarifies the contribution of LGN nonlinearities to the orientation tuning of simple cells and demonstrates how these nonlinearities may impact different models of contrast-invariant tuning.},

abstract = {We have explored the spatial organization of orientation contrast effects in primate V1. Our stimuli were either concentric patches of drifting grating of varying orientation and diameter or grating patches displaced in x-y coordinates around a central patch overlying the classical receptive field (CRF). All cells in the sample exhibited response suppression to iso-oriented stimuli exceeding the CRF. Changing the outer stimulus orientation revealed five response patterns: 1) orientation alignment suppression (17{\%} of cells)-a suppressive component tuned to the same orientation as the cell's optimal, 2) orientation contrast facilitation (63{\%})-responses to orientation contrast stimuli exceeded those to the center stimulus alone, 3) nonorientation specific suppression (3{\%}), 4) mixed general suppression and alignment suppression (14{\%}), and 5) orientation contrast suppression (14{\%})-cross-oriented stimuli evoked stronger suppression than iso-oriented stimuli. Thus most cells (94{\%}) showed larger responses to orientation contrast stimuli than to iso-oriented stimuli, and over one-half showed orientation contrast facilitation. There appeared to be a spatially structured organization of the zones driving the different response patterns with respect to the CRF. Nonorientation-specific suppression and orientation contrast suppression were predominantly evoked by orientation contrast borders located within the CRF, and orientation contrast facilitation was mainly driven by surround stimuli lying outside the CRF. This led to different response patterns according to border location. Zones driving orientation contrast facilitation were not necessarily contiguous to, nor uniformly distributed around, the CRF. Our data support two processes underlying orientation contrast enhancement effects: a simple variation in the strength of surround suppression drawing on the fact that surround suppression is tuned to the same orientation as the CRF and a second process driven by orientation contrast that enhanced cells' responses to CRF stimulation by either dis-inhibition or orientation contrast facilitation. We suggest these processes may serve to enhance response levels to salient image features such as junctions and corners and may contribute to orientation pop-out.},

abstract = {The location, topographic organization, and function of the middle temporal visual area (MT) in the macaque monkey was studied using anatomical and physiological techniques. MT is a small, elliptically shaped area on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be identified by its direct inputs from striate cortex and by its distinctive pattern of heavy myelination. Its average surface area is 33 mm2, which is less than 3{\%} of the size of striate cortex. It contains a complete, topographically organized representation of the contralateral visual hemifield. There are substantial irregularities in the detailed pattern of topographic organization, however, and the representation is significantly more complex than that found for MT in other primates. Much of MT is devoted to the representation of central visual fields, with the emphasis on central vision being similar to that found in striate cortex. Electrophysiological recordings have confirmed previous reports of a high incidence of direction selective cells in MT. The transition in functional properties, from cells lacking direction selectivity outside MT to direction selective cells within, occurs over a distance of 0.1-0.2 mm or less along the lateral border of MT. Such a transition does not occur along the medial border, however, as the cortex medial to MT contains many cells with strong direction selectivity. Nevertheless, this region differs from MT in its myeloarchitecture, its lack of inputs from striate cortex, and the large size of its receptive fields. These results demonstrate the existence of three distinct visual areas on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be distinguished on the basis of both physiological and anatomical criteria.},

abstract = {The precise location of physiologically identified specific afferent input on the different types of cell in the visual cortex and the identification of the neurotransmitters of these cells are essential to a better understanding of the first stage of cortical processing. A combination of anatomical, neurochemical, and physiological methods was used to identify the cortical neurones that receive synaptic input from X- and Y-type afferents, which are thought to originate from cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. One method relied on chance contacts made between single physiologically characterised axons, which had been injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and the processes of cells impregnated by the Golgi method. These experiments revealed that both X and Y axons formed synapses on the dendrites of spiny stellate cells in layer 4. Y axons in both areas 17 and 18 established multiple synaptic contacts on basal dendrites of layer 3 pyramidal cells. One X axon contacted the apical dendrite of a layer 5 pyramidal cell and one Y axon contacted the dendrite of a large cell with smooth dendrites in layer 3. The maximum number of synapses made between one axon and a single postsynaptic cell was eight, although in most cases it was only one. It was concluded that one axon only provides a small fraction of the geniculate afferent input to an individual cell. A second method revealed that the somata in layer 4 in synaptic contact with the HRP-filled axon terminals were GABA-immunoreactive, and therefore might be involved in inhibitory processes. From light microscopic data it was found that somata receiving contacts from X axons in area 17 were significantly smaller (average diameter 15 microns) than those contacted by the Y axons in areas 17 and 18 (average diameter 24 microns). Somatic contacts were extremely rare in layer 6. These data show that the X and Y afferents may activate separate subsets of inhibitory neurones.},

abstract = {The origin of orientation selectivity in visual cortical responses is a central problem for understanding cerebral cortical circuitry. In cats, many experiments suggest that orientation selectivity arises from the arrangement of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) afferents to layer 4 simple cells. However, this explanation is not sufficient to account for the contrast invariance of orientation tuning. To understand contrast invariance, we first characterize the input to cat simple cells generated by the oriented arrangement of LGN afferents. We demonstrate that it has two components: a spatial-phase-specific component (i.e., one that depends on receptive field spatial phase), which is tuned for orientation, and a phase-nonspecific component, which is untuned. Both components grow with contrast. Second, we show that a correlation-based intracortical circuit, in which connectivity between cell pairs is determined by the correlation of their LGN inputs, is sufficient to achieve well tuned, contrast-invariant orientation tuning. This circuit generates both spatially opponent, "antiphase" inhibition ("push-pull"), and spatially matched, "same-phase" excitation. The inhibition, if sufficiently strong, suppresses the untuned input component and sharpens responses to the tuned component at all contrasts. The excitation amplifies tuned responses. This circuit agrees with experimental evidence showing spatial opponency between, and similar orientation tuning of, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs received by a simple cell. Orientation tuning is primarily input driven, accounting for the observed invariance of tuning width after removal of intracortical synaptic input, as well as for the dependence of orientation tuning on stimulus spatial frequency. The model differs from previous push-pull models in requiring dominant rather than balanced inhibition and in predicting that a population of layer 4 inhibitory neurons should respond in a contrast-dependent manner to stimuli of all orientations, although their tuning width may be similar to that of excitatory neurons. The model demonstrates that fundamental response properties of cortical layer 4 can be explained by circuitry expected to develop under correlation-based rules of synaptic plasticity, and shows how such circuitry allows the cortex to distinguish stimulus intensity from stimulus form.},

abstract = {Afferent feedback from muscles and skin has been suggested to influence our emotions during the control of facial expressions. Recent imaging studies have shown that imitation of facial expressions is associated with activation in limbic regions such as the amygdala. Yet, the physiological interaction between this limbic activation and facial feedback remains unclear. To study if facial feedback effects on limbic brain responses during intentional imitation of facial expressions, we applied botulinum toxin (BTX)-induced denervation of frown muscles in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging as a reversible lesion model to minimize the occurrence of afferent muscular and cutaneous input. We show that, during imitation of angry facial expressions, reduced feedback due to BTX treatment attenuates activation of the left amygdala and its functional coupling with brain stem regions implicated in autonomic manifestations of emotional states. These findings demonstrate that facial feedback modulates neural activity within central circuitries of emotion during intentional imitation of facial expressions. Given that people tend to mimic the emotional expressions of others, this could provide a potential physiological basis for the social transfer of emotion.},

abstract = {Although it is thought that orientation selectivity first emerges in the primary visual cortex, several studies have reported that neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are sensitive to stimulus orientation, especially for high spatial frequency (SF) stimuli. To understand how this orientation sensitivity emerges, we investigated the spatiotemporal structures of linear receptive fields (RFs) of LGN neurons. Orientation tunings at several SFs were measured using sinusoidal drifting grating stimuli. Fine spatiotemporal structures of the linear RFs were measured using a reverse correlation technique and two-dimensional dynamic Gaussian white noise stimuli. A non-linear response modulation function was estimated by comparing measured responses with responses predicted from a linear RF structure. Although we found that a population of LGN neurons exhibited significantly elongated linear RF centers and that the angles of the long axes corresponded well to the preferred orientations, the orientation tunings predicted from the linear RFs were significantly broader than those measured. These results suggest that orientation-tuned non-linear response modulation induced by stimulation outside the classical RF contributes to the sharp orientation tuning seen in LGN neurons. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Orientation selectivity is a property of mammalian primary visual cortex (V1) neurons, yet its emergence along the visual pathway varies across species. In carnivores and primates, elongated receptive fields first appear in V1, whereas in lagomorphs such receptive fields emerge earlier, in the retina. Here we examine the mouse visual pathway and reveal the existence of orientation selectivity in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) relay cells. Cortical inactivation does not reduce this orientation selectivity, indicating that cortical feedback is not its source. Orientation selectivity is similar for LGN relay cells spiking and subthreshold input to V1 neurons, suggesting that cortical orientation selectivity is inherited from the LGN in mouse. In contrast, orientation selectivity of cat LGN relay cells is small relative to subthreshold inputs onto V1 simple cells. Together, these differences show that although orientation selectivity exists in visual neurons of both rodents and carnivores, its emergence along the visual pathway, and thus its underlying neuronal circuitry, is fundamentally different.},

Recent findings from neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) have shown that individual cells respond selectively and invariantly to representations of famous people [Quian Quiroga R, Reddy L, Kreiman G, Koch C, Fried I (2005) Nature 435(7045):1102-1107]. Observing these cells, we wondered whether photographs of personally relevant individuals, such as family members, might be more likely to generate such responses. To address this issue, we recorded the activity of 2,330 neurons in the human MTL while patients viewed photographs of varying personal relevance: previously unknown faces and landscapes, familiar but not necessarily personally relevant faces and landscapes, and finally, photographs of the patients themselves, their families, and the experimenters. Our findings indicate that personally relevant photographs are indeed more likely to elicit selective responses in MTL neurons than photographs of individuals with whom the patients have had no personal contact. These findings further suggest that relevant stimuli are encoded by a larger proportion of neurons than less relevant stimuli, given that familiar or personally relevant items are linked to a larger variety of experiences and memories of these experiences.},

abstract = {Feedback connections to early-level sensory neurons have been shown to affect many characteristics of their neural response. Because selectivity for stimulus size is a fundamental property of visual neurons, we examined the summation tuning and discretely mapped receptive field (RF) properties of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) both with and without feedback from visual cortex. Using extracellular recording in halothane-anesthetized cats, we used small luminance probes displaced in Cartesian coordinates to measure discrete response area, and optimal sinusoidal gratings of varying diameter to estimate preferred optimal summation size and level of center-surround antagonism. In conditions where most cortical feedback was pharmacologically removed, discretely mapped RF response areas showed an overall significant enlargement for the population compared with control conditions. A switch to increased levels of burst firing, spatially displaced from the RF center, suggested this was mediated by changes in excitatory-inhibitory balance across visual space. With the use of coextensive stimulation, there were overall highly significant increases in the optimal summation size and reduction of surround antagonism with removal of cortical feedback in the LGN. When fitted with a difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) model, changes in the center size, center amplitude, and surround amplitude parameters were most significantly related to the removal of cortical feedback. In summary, corticothalamic innervation of the visual thalamus can modify spatial summation properties in LGN relay cells, an effect most parsimoniously explained by changes in the excitatory-inhibitory balance.},

abstract = {This report describes a new modification of the Gallyas method for staining myelin in fixed brain tissue and compares results of multiple myelin-visualizing techniques in normal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), normal macaque monkey (Macaca mulatta), and a human with multiple sclerosis. The new modification involves immersion in 10{\%} formalin following impregnation in ammoniacal silver nitrate, and the use of a low concentration of 4{\%} paraformaldehyde in the developer. This improved technique is less sensitive to post-mortem tissue handling, temperature, and minor contaminants, allowing a more straightforward implementation in the laboratory setting. It permits simple user-controlled development of the reaction product to maximize contrast in the area of interest, resulting in high contrast staining not only of large axonal bundles, but also thin fascicles throughout tissue sections. Myelin staining in visual cortex of an Old World monkey and a New World monkey reveals similar patterns in the new myelin silver stain, the Gallyas stain, and myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry. The most heavily myelinated areas occupy the edges of blobs, but neither the most lightly stained nor the most darkly stained areas are always in our outside a blob. This indicates a more complex pattern between myelinated axons and blobs than previously suggested. While the new myelin silver stain, darkfield microscopy, the Luxol Fast Blue stain, the Gallyas stain, and myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry all permit visualization of myelin in the CNS, each technique has its own merits and pitfalls; careful evaluation of individual study requirements would best determine which methods are the most useful.},

abstract = {In the visual cortex of higher mammals, neurons are arranged across the cortical surface in an orderly map of preferred stimulus orientations. This map contains 'orientation pinwheels', structures that are arranged like the spokes of a wheel such that orientation changes continuously around a centre. Conventional optical imaging first demonstrated these pinwheels, but the technique lacked the spatial resolution to determine the response properties and arrangement of cells near pinwheel centres. Electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres, but it remained unclear whether they were arranged randomly or in an orderly fashion. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in vivo to determine the microstructure of pinwheel centres in cat visual cortex with single-cell resolution. We find that pinwheel centres are highly ordered: neurons selective to different orientations are clearly segregated even in the very centre. Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the cortical map. This highly ordered arrangement at the level of single cells suggests great precision in the development of cortical circuits underlying orientation selectivity.},

abstract = {The role of intrinsic cortical connections in processing sensory input and in generating behavioral output is poorly understood. We have examined this issue in the context of the tuning of neuronal responses in cortex to the orientation of a visual stimulus. We analytically study a simple network model that incorporates both orientation-selective input from the lateral geniculate nucleus and orientation-specific cortical interactions. Depending on the model parameters, the network exhibits orientation selectivity that originates from within the cortex, by a symmetry-breaking mechanism. In this case, the width of the orientation tuning can be sharp even if the lateral geniculate nucleus inputs are only weakly anisotropic. By using our model, several experimental consequences of this cortical mechanism of orientation tuning are derived. The tuning width is relatively independent of the contrast and angular anisotropy of the visual stimulus. The transient population response to changing of the stimulus orientation exhibits a slow "virtual rotation." Neuronal cross-correlations exhibit long time tails, the sign of which depends on the preferred orientations of the cells and the stimulus orientation.},

At the time, they proposed an elegant and enduring model for the origin of orientation selectivity. Fig. 1A, which is adapted from their original paper and which contains the essence of their model, is by now familiar to most students of the visual system and to many others besides. Yet the model, and the central question that it addresses, is still the subject of intense debate.

@article{Hillock2011,
abstract = {We live in a multisensory world and one of the challenges the brain is faced with is deciding what information belongs together. Our ability to make assumptions about the relatedness of multisensory stimuli is partly based on their temporal and spatial relationships. Stimuli that are proximal in time and space are likely to be bound together by the brain and ascribed to a common external event. Using this framework we can describe multisensory processes in the context of spatial and temporal filters or windows that compute the probability of the relatedness of stimuli. Whereas numerous studies have examined the characteristics of these multisensory filters in adults and discrepancies in window size have been reported between infants and adults, virtually nothing is known about multisensory temporal processing in childhood. To examine this, we compared the ability of 10 and 11 year olds and adults to detect audiovisual temporal asynchrony. Findings revealed striking and asymmetric age-related differences. Whereas children were able to identify asynchrony as readily as adults when visual stimuli preceded auditory cues, significant group differences were identified at moderately long stimulus onset asynchronies (150-350 ms) where the auditory stimulus was first. Results suggest that changes in audiovisual temporal perception extend beyond the first decade of life. In addition to furthering our understanding of basic multisensory developmental processes, these findings have implications on disorders (e.g., autism, dyslexia) in which emerging evidence suggests alterations in multisensory temporal function.},

abstract = {Here we report that the extended surround outside the classical receptive center (hereafter called the extended surround) of most retinal ganglion cells in the cat exhibit significant orientation bias to grating stimuli, and that the center and the extended surround show different orientation biases at different spatial frequencies. As a result, some retinal ganglion cells possess a complex receptive field structure, which allows them to detect sophisticated image segmentation (e.g. texture segmentation) in addition to simple luminance edges. This property was previously thought to exist primarily in the visual cortex. Moreover, in about one quarter of 128 cells studied the center did not exhibit an orientation bias. Thus, these surrounds alone may determine the cells' orientation bias. In conclusion, the extended surround may play an important role in processing more complex pattern in natural scenes since the classical receptive field is too small to describe all the properties of a retinal ganglion cell.

abstract = {Although orientation columns are less than a millimeter in width, recent neuroimaging studies indicate that viewed orientations can be decoded from cortical activity patterns sampled at relatively coarse resolutions of several millimeters. One proposal is that these differential signals arise from random spatial irregularities in the columnar map. However, direct support for this hypothesis has yet to be obtained. Here, we used high-field, high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis to determine the spatial scales at which orientation-selective information can be found in the primary visual cortex (V1) of cats and humans. We applied a multiscale pattern analysis approach in which fine- and coarse-scale signals were first removed by ideal spatial lowpass and highpass filters, and the residual activity patterns then analyzed by linear classifiers. Cat visual cortex, imaged at 0.3125 mm resolution, showed a strong orientation signal at the scale of individual columns. Nonetheless, reliable orientation bias could still be found at spatial scales of several millimeters. In the human visual cortex, imaged at 1 mm resolution, a majority of orientation information was found on scales of millimeters, with small contributions from global spatial biases exceeding approximately 1 cm. Our high-resolution imaging results demonstrate a reliable millimeters-scale orientation signal, likely emerging from irregular spatial arrangements of orientation columns and their supporting vasculature. fMRI pattern analysis methods are thus likely to be sensitive to signals originating from other irregular columnar structures elsewhere in the brain.},

abstract = {A fundamental claim associated with parallel distributed processing (PDP) theories of cognition is that knowledge is coded in a distributed manner in mind and brain. This approach rejects the claim that knowledge is coded in a localist fashion, with words, objects, and simple concepts (e.g. "dog"), that is, coded with their own dedicated representations. One of the putative advantages of this approach is that the theories are biologically plausible. Indeed, advocates of the PDP approach often highlight the close parallels between distributed representations learned in connectionist models and neural coding in brain and often dismiss localist (grandmother cell) theories as biologically implausible. The author reviews a range a data that strongly challenge this claim and shows that localist models provide a better account of single-cell recording studies. The author also contrast local and alternative distributed coding schemes (sparse and coarse coding) and argues that common rejection of grandmother cell theories in neuroscience is due to a misunderstanding about how localist models behave. The author concludes that the localist representations embedded in theories of perception and cognition are consistent with neuroscience; biology only calls into question the distributed representations often learned in PDP models.},

abstract = {Electrical microstimulation has been used to elucidate cortical function. This review discusses neuronal excitability and effective current spread estimated by using three different methods: 1) single-cell recording, 2) behavioral methods, and 3) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The excitability properties of the stimulated elements in neocortex obtained using these methods were found to be comparable. These properties suggested that microstimulation activates the most excitable elements in cortex, that is, by and large the fibers of the pyramidal cells. Effective current spread within neocortex was found to be greater when measured with fMRI compared with measures based on single-cell recording or behavioral methods. The spread of activity based on behavioral methods is in close agreement with the spread based on the direct activation of neurons (as opposed to those activated synaptically). We argue that the greater activation with imaging is attributed to transynaptic spread, which includes subthreshold activation of sites connected to the site of stimulation. The definition of effective current spread therefore depends on the neural event being measured.},

abstract = {Neurons in the cerebral cortex are organized into anatomical columns, with ensembles of cells arranged from the surface to the white matter. Within a column, neurons often share functional properties, such as selectivity for stimulus orientation; columns with distinct properties, such as different preferred orientations, tile the cortical surface in orderly patterns. This functional architecture was discovered with the relatively sparse sampling of microelectrode recordings. Optical imaging of membrane voltage or metabolic activity elucidated the overall geometry of functional maps, but is averaged over many cells (resolution {\textgreater}100 microm). Consequently, the purity of functional domains and the precision of the borders between them could not be resolved. Here, we labelled thousands of neurons of the visual cortex with a calcium-sensitive indicator in vivo. We then imaged the activity of neuronal populations at single-cell resolution with two-photon microscopy up to a depth of 400 microm. In rat primary visual cortex, neurons had robust orientation selectivity but there was no discernible local structure; neighbouring neurons often responded to different orientations. In area 18 of cat visual cortex, functional maps were organized at a fine scale. Neurons with opposite preferences for stimulus direction were segregated with extraordinary spatial precision in three dimensions, with columnar borders one to two cells wide. These results indicate that cortical maps can be built with single-cell precision.},

This selectivity can be disrupted by the application of antagonists of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to a local region of the cortex. In order to determine whether inhibitory inputs are necessary for a single cortical neuron to show orientation selectivity, GABA receptors were blocked intracellularly during whole cell recording. Although the membrane potential, spontaneous activity, subfield antagonism, and directional selectivity of neurons were altered after they were perfused internally with the blocking solution, 18 out of 18 neurons remained selective for stimulus orientation. These results indicate that excitatory inputs are sufficient to generate orientation selectivity.},

abstract = {Simple and complex cells of striate cortex of anaesthetized and paralysed cats were stimulated with two superimposed one-dimensional grating stimuli of different orientations to investigate inhibitory effects of non-optimally oriented stimuli. We confirmed that a stimulus of orientation orthogonal to a cell's long axis significantly reduces the cell's discharge rate. Further experiments revealed the following. (i) The inhibition was typically stronger for simple than for complex cells. (ii) It is very broadly tuned for orientation, all orientations outside the cell's tuning band having a comparable inhibitory effect. (iii) Similarly, it is broadly tuned for spatial frequency. These last two results suggest that the inhibition arises not from a single cell but from a pool of cells. (iv) The pattern of the discharge of the inhibition in response to stimulation by phase-reversed sinusoidal gratings is consistent with the notion that the inhibition arises from complex cells. A second series of recordings of stimulation by visual noise patterns demonstrated how 'cross-orientation inhibition' prevents simple cells from responding to two-dimensional visual noise while allowing them to respond to comparable one-dimensional noise patterns. We suggest that this mechanism may serve to render simple cells selectively sensitive to one-dimensional stimuli, such as the contours or borders of visual objects.},

abstract = {Simple cells in primary visual cortex exhibit contrast-invariant orientation tuning, in seeming contradiction to feed-forward models that rely on lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input alone. Contrast invariance has therefore been thought to depend on the presence of intracortical lateral inhibition. In vivo intracellular recordings instead suggest that contrast invariance can be explained by three properties of the excitatory pathway. (1) Depolarizations evoked by orthogonal stimuli are determined by the amount of excitation a cell receives from the LGN, relative to the excitation it receives from other cortical cells. (2) Depolarizations evoked by preferred stimuli saturate at lower contrasts than the spike output of LGN relay cells. (3) Visual stimuli evoke contrast-dependent changes in trial-to-trial variability, which lead to contrast-dependent changes in the relationship between membrane potential and spike rate. Thus, high-contrast, orthogonally oriented stimuli that evoke significant depolarizations evoke few spikes. Together these mechanisms, without lateral inhibition, can account for contrast-invariant stimulus selectivity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The spatial properties of the extraclassical receptive fields (ECRF) of neurons responding to a stimulus restricted to it and its interaction with the classical receptive field (CRF) in visual information processing were investigated in 74 relay cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) of anesthetized cats. The results demonstrate that the ECRF of most relay cells in the LGNd responded preferentially to a grating stimulus of low spatial frequency through a mechanism of spatial summation. These biased cells showed a significant orientation bias which was relatively smaller than that of the CRF. The preferred orientations of the ECRF were not correlated with those of the CRF in most relay cells. The orientation biased ECRFs and CRFs interacted with each other in a non-linear way, resulting in a great diversity of response properties. Overall, the CRF played a more significant role than the ECRF in determining a cell's orientation bias and preferred orientation. The ECRF mostly showed a modulatory role mainly in suppressing and/or in partially facilitating the neural response to stimulation in the CRF although in some cases, the ECRF did determine a cell's responsiveness and orientation sensitivity. These results suggest that the ECRF might contribute to the ability of the LGNd neurons to detect some complex features such as texture segmentation and provide a subcortical contribution to the integrative field of visual cortical cells through receiving inputs from retinal ganglion cells with similar orientation biased extended surrounds [Neuroscience 98 (2000) 207]. {\textcopyright} 2004 IBRO.

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are thought to receive inhibition from other V1 neurons selective for a variety of orientations. Evidence for this inhibition is commonly found in cross-orientation suppression: responses of a V1 neuron to optimally oriented bars are suppressed by superimposed mask bars of different orientation. We show, however, that suppression is unlikely to result from intracortical inhibition. First, suppression can be obtained with masks drifting too rapidly to elicit much of a response in cortex. Second, suppression is immune to hyperpolarization (through visual adaptation) of cortical neurons responding to the mask. Signals mediating suppression might originate in thalamus, rather than in cortex. Thalamic neurons exhibit some suppression; additional suppression might arise from depression at thalamocortical synapses. The mechanisms of suppression are subcortical and possibly include the very first synapse into cortex.},

The PSPs were recorded using in vivo whole-cell technique, and we analyzed the orientation tuning during subsequent temporal windows after stimulus onset and offset. Our results show that the amplitudes of the postsynaptic potential are reliably tuned to orientation and matching that of the spike responses only during certain temporal windows. During the first 100 ms after stimulus presentation, orientation tuning of the membrane potential underwent regular changes. Within particular intervals, orientation tuning of the input was much sharper than that estimated according to the whole response. In most cells, optimal orientation was usually stable over the whole period. In several cells which had a second hump of EPSPs in the response, this second hump was tuned to the same orientation as the first one, but always showed sharper tuning. Estimation of the integration time revealed sufficient delay between the appearance of EPSPs and spikes, to let inhibition influence spike generation. These results show that orientation selectivity of the input to cortical cells is a dynamic function, and also indicate the possibility of temporal coding in the visual system.},

abstract = {Optical imaging based on intrinsic signals was used to analyze the structure of orientation column in area 18 of cat visual cortex. Recordings were obtained in 12 adult cats during presentation of contours in various orientations. In order to quantitatively evaluate the size of the response area, a method combining both information on the amplitude of the changes and the statistical significance of the changes was proposed. The results showed that the proportion of the cortical area activated reached a peak during the presentation of horizontal or vertical contours, whereas the areas activated by oblique contours were relatively smaller. Cardinal contours (0 degrees and 90 degrees ) activated 50.63 +/- 1.88{\%} (mean +/- SE) of the cortical area in the recording site, whereas oblique contours (45 degrees and 135 degrees ) activated only 45.25 +/- 2.02{\%} of the area. This difference in area was statistically significant (t = 2.38, d.f. = 11, and P {\textless} 0.05). The results demonstrated a difference in the representations of the cardinal and oblique contours in area 18 of the cat visual cortex.},

@article{Celebrini1993,
abstract = {To investigate the importance of feedback loops in visual information processing, we have analyzed the dynamic aspects of neuronal responses to oriented gratings in cortical area V1 of the awake primate. If recurrent feedback is important in generating orientation selectivity, the initial part of the neuronal response should be relatively poorly selective, and full orientation selectivity should only appear after a delay. Thus, by examining the dynamics of the neuronal responses it should be possible to assess the importance of feedback processes in the development of orientation selectivity. The results were base on a sample of 259 cells recorded in two monkeys, of which 89{\%} were visually responsive. Of these, approximately two-thirds were orientation selective. Response latency varied considerably between neurons, ranging from a minimum of 41 ms to over 150 ms, although most had latencies of 50-70 ms. Orientation tuning (defined as the bandwidth at half-height) ranged from 16 deg to over 90 deg, with a mean value of around 55 deg. By examining the selectivity of these different neurons by 10-ms time slices, starting at the onset of the neuronal response, we found that the orientation selectivity of virtually every neuron was fully developed at the very start of the neuronal response. Indeed, many neurons showed a marked tendency to respond at somewhat longer latencies to stimuli that were nonoptimally oriented, with the result that orientation selectivity was highest at the very start of the neuronal response. Furthermore, there was no evidence that the neurons with the shortest onset latencies were less selective. Such evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that recurrent intracortical feedback plays an important role in the generation of orientation selectivity. Instead, we suggest that orientation selectivity is primarily generated using feedforward mechanisms, including feedforward inhibition. Such a strategy has the advantage of allowing orientation to be computed rapidly, and avoids the initially poorly selective neuronal responses that characterize processing involving recurrent loops.},

@article{Dombeck2007,
abstract = {We report a technique for two-photon fluorescence imaging with cellular resolution in awake, behaving mice with minimal motion artifact. The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to approximately 2-5 microm. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of {\textless}5{\%}.},

The concept refers to the suppression of actions that are no longer required or that are inappropriate, which supports flexible and goal-directed behavior in ever-changing environments. The stop-signal paradigm is most suitable for the study of response inhibition in a laboratory setting. The paradigm has become increasingly popular in cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience and psychopathology. We review recent findings in the stop-signal literature with the specific aim of demonstrating how each of these different fields contributes to a better understanding of the processes involved in inhibiting a response and monitoring stopping performance, and more generally, discovering how behavior is controlled.},
