abstract = {Golgi and axonal transport techniques have been used to examine the organization of neurons within primary visual cortex, area 17, of the cat. This organization has been compared to that of the primate cortical area 17 as described in previous studies and it is discussed in relationship to the distribution of afferents from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The visual cortex of the cat and monkey show strong similarities in the laminar positions of neurons projecting extrinsically and also in the restriction of spiny stellate neurons to a central lamina (lamina 4) receiving input from the dLGN. However, lamina 4B in the monkey, which contains spiny stellate neurons but does not receive direct input from the dLGN, has no direct counterpart in cat area 17. Axon projections of spiny stellate neurons in the other divisions of lamina 4 differ in cat and monkey: the small, closely packed neurons in the lowermost division of lamina 4 (4B in the cat, 4Cbeta in the monkey) project chiefly within lamina 4 in the cat whereas in the monkey they have a strong projection to lamina 3. In the cat, spiny stellate neurons of lamina 4A project upon lamina 3 whereas in the monkey those in the apparently equivalent zone, 4Calpha, project upon lamina 4B. Most non-spiny stellate neurons examined have precisely organized interlaminar axonal projections which differ from the axon trajectories of neighboring spiny neurons.},

@article{Tehovnik2013,
abstract = {Based on two-photon calcium imaging, Histed et al. (2009) concluded that electrical microstimulation of cortical tissue in mammals activates a sparse and distributed population of neurons. This work has been cited by many as proof that electrical microstimulation is nonfocal, which means it may lack the precision needed for applications in neuroprosthetics. We affirm that the generation of stimulation-evoked behaviour is based primarily on the orthodromic conduction of signals originating mainly from the deepest layers of cortex, while the work of Histed et al. is effectively limited to investigating the antidromic activation of lateral projection neurons of the superficial cortex. The apparent sparse activation is a consequence of the pattern of axonal projections based on activating a volume of axons while imaging cell bodies transecting a single plane through the cortex. This creates the false impression that the distribution of activated neurons is sparse and nonfocal. We recommend how two-photon calcium imaging, which is superb for the study of individual and groups of neurons, might be more effectively used to ascertain how electrical stimulation affects the brains of mammals. This is a timely topic since investigators are using electrical microstimulation in animals to develop prosthetic devices to restore sensory and motor functions in disabled patients.},

abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that people's facial activity influences their affective responses. Two studies were designed to both eliminate methodological problems of earlier experiments and clarify theoretical ambiguities. This was achieved by having subjects hold a pen in their mouth in ways that either inhibited or facilitated the muscles typically associated with smiling without requiring subjects to pose in a smiling face. Study 1's results demonstrated the effectiveness of the procedure. Subjects reported more intense humor responses when cartoons were presented under facilitating conditions than under inhibiting conditions that precluded labeling of the facial expression in emotion categories. Study 2 served to further validate the methodology and to answer additional theoretical questions. The results replicated Study 1's findings and also showed that facial feedback operates on the affective but not on the cognitive component of the humor response. Finally, the results suggested that both inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms may have contributed to the observed affective responses.},

@article{Pistorio2006,
abstract = {This report describes a new modification of the Gallyas method for staining myelin in fixed brain tissue and compares results of multiple myelin-visualizing techniques in normal common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), normal macaque monkey (Macaca mulatta), and a human with multiple sclerosis. The new modification involves immersion in 10{\%} formalin following impregnation in ammoniacal silver nitrate, and the use of a low concentration of 4{\%} paraformaldehyde in the developer. This improved technique is less sensitive to post-mortem tissue handling, temperature, and minor contaminants, allowing a more straightforward implementation in the laboratory setting. It permits simple user-controlled development of the reaction product to maximize contrast in the area of interest, resulting in high contrast staining not only of large axonal bundles, but also thin fascicles throughout tissue sections. Myelin staining in visual cortex of an Old World monkey and a New World monkey reveals similar patterns in the new myelin silver stain, the Gallyas stain, and myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry. The most heavily myelinated areas occupy the edges of blobs, but neither the most lightly stained nor the most darkly stained areas are always in our outside a blob. This indicates a more complex pattern between myelinated axons and blobs than previously suggested. While the new myelin silver stain, darkfield microscopy, the Luxol Fast Blue stain, the Gallyas stain, and myelin basic protein immunohistochemistry all permit visualization of myelin in the CNS, each technique has its own merits and pitfalls; careful evaluation of individual study requirements would best determine which methods are the most useful.},

@article{Horton2005,
abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A "column" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term "column" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

@article{Heinzle2007,
abstract = {The cortical control of eye movements is highly sophisticated. Not only can eye movements be made to the most salient target in a visual scene, but they can also be controlled by top-down rules as is required for visual search or reading. The cortical area called frontal eye fields (FEF) has been shown to play a key role in the visual to oculomotor transformations in tasks requiring an eye movement pattern that is not completely reactive, but follows a previously learned rule. The layered, local cortical circuit, which provides the anatomical substrate for all cortical computation, has been studied extensively in primary sensory cortex. These studies led to the concept of a "canonical circuit" for neocortex (Douglas et al., 1989; Douglas and Martin, 1991), which proposes that all areas of neocortex share a common basic circuit. However, it has not ever been explored whether in principle the detailed canonical circuit derived from cat area 17 (Binzegger et al., 2004) could implement the quite different functions of prefrontal cortex. Here, we show that the canonical circuit can, with a few modifications, model the primate FEF. The spike-based network of integrate-and-fire neurons was tested in tasks that were used in electrophysiological experiments in behaving macaque monkeys. The dynamics of the model matched those of neurons observed in the FEF, and the behavioral results matched those observed in psychophysical experiments. The close relationship between the model and the cortical architecture allows a detailed comparison of the simulation results with physiological data and predicts details of the anatomical circuit of the FEF.},

@article{Murasugi1993,
abstract = {We have previously shown that perceptual judgements of motion direction are based in part on the activity of direction selective neurons in extrastriate visual area MT (Salzman et al., 1990, 1992). In those experiments, we applied low-amplitude microstimulation pulses (10 microA, 200 Hz) to clusters of MT neurons whose preferred directions were similar. The effect of microstimulation was to bias the monkeys' choices on a direction discrimination task toward the preferred direction of neurons at the stimulation site. The results suggest that microstimulation generated a directionally specific cortical signal by activating selectively neurons near the electrode tip. To test this notion more directly, we have now examined the behavioral effects of varying current amplitude, current frequency, and electrode position. In the majority of experiments, the directional bias in the monkeys' choices was reduced or eliminated as current amplitude increased to 80 microA. In addition, 80 microA stimulating pulses frequently impaired overall performance as measured by the percentage of correct responses. This decrement in performance indicated that 80 microA pulses introduced "noise" into the neural circuitry encoding motion direction, presumably by increasing current spread to activate a larger population of neurons representing all directions of motion. In contrast, increasing current frequency to 500 Hz (10 microA pulses) preserved the directional specificity of microstimulation effects. The precise position of the stimulating electrode also influenced the magnitude of microstimulation effects; in some cases, differences in position on the order of 100 microns determined whether an experiment yielded a very large effect or no effect at all. Thus, directionally specific activation of cortical circuitry within MT can be disrupted by increases in current spread or by small changes in electrode position. These observations suggest that the effects of low-amplitude microstimulation depend upon direct activation of a well-localized population of neurons.},

Combined, these deficits may contribute to the continuation of use in dependent individuals and may qualify as important targets for therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {The neuropsychological basis of attentional set-shifting, task-set switching and stop-signal inhibition is reviewed through comparative studies of humans and experimental animals. Using human functional neuroimaging, plus neuropsychological investigation of patients with frontal damage quantified by structural magnetic resonance imaging, and through parallels with effects of specific lesions of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum in rats and marmosets, it is possible to define both distinct and overlapping loci for tasks such as extra-dimensional shifting and reversal learning, stop-signal reaction time and task-set switching. Notably, most of the paradigms implicate a locus in the right PFC, specifically the right inferior frontal gyrus, possibly associated with processes of response inhibition. The neurochemical modulation of fronto-striatal circuitry in parallel with effects on task performance has been investigated using specific neuropharmacological agents in animals and by human psychopharmacological investigations, sometimes in conjunction with functional imaging. Evidence is provided for double dissociations of effects of manipulations of prefrontal cortical catecholamine and indoleamine (5-HT) systems that have considerable implications in the treatment of disorders such as Parkinson's disease, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and depression, as well as in theoretical notions of how 'fronto-executive' functions are subject to state-dependent influences, probably related to stress, arousal and motivation.},

abstract = {The precise location of physiologically identified specific afferent input on the different types of cell in the visual cortex and the identification of the neurotransmitters of these cells are essential to a better understanding of the first stage of cortical processing. A combination of anatomical, neurochemical, and physiological methods was used to identify the cortical neurones that receive synaptic input from X- and Y-type afferents, which are thought to originate from cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. One method relied on chance contacts made between single physiologically characterised axons, which had been injected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and the processes of cells impregnated by the Golgi method. These experiments revealed that both X and Y axons formed synapses on the dendrites of spiny stellate cells in layer 4. Y axons in both areas 17 and 18 established multiple synaptic contacts on basal dendrites of layer 3 pyramidal cells. One X axon contacted the apical dendrite of a layer 5 pyramidal cell and one Y axon contacted the dendrite of a large cell with smooth dendrites in layer 3. The maximum number of synapses made between one axon and a single postsynaptic cell was eight, although in most cases it was only one. It was concluded that one axon only provides a small fraction of the geniculate afferent input to an individual cell. A second method revealed that the somata in layer 4 in synaptic contact with the HRP-filled axon terminals were GABA-immunoreactive, and therefore might be involved in inhibitory processes. From light microscopic data it was found that somata receiving contacts from X axons in area 17 were significantly smaller (average diameter 15 microns) than those contacted by the Y axons in areas 17 and 18 (average diameter 24 microns). Somatic contacts were extremely rare in layer 6. These data show that the X and Y afferents may activate separate subsets of inhibitory neurones.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that some neurons in extrastriate area MT are capable of signaling the global motion of complex patterns; neurons randomly sampled from V1, on the other hand, respond only to the motion of individual oriented components. Because only a small fraction of V1 neurons projects to MT, we wished to establish the processing hierarchy more precisely by studying the properties of those neurons projecting to MT, identified by antidromic responses to electrical stimulation of MT. The neurons that project from V1 to MT were directionally selective and, like other V1 neurons, responded only to the motion of the components of complex patterns. The projection neurons were predominantly "special complex," responsive to a broad range of spatial and temporal frequencies, and sensitive to very low stimulus contrasts. The projection neurons thus comprise a homogeneous and highly specialized subset of V1 neurons, consistent with the notion that V1 acts as clearing house of basic visual measurements, distributing information appropriately to higher cortical areas for specialized analysis.},

abstract = {Studies in anesthetized animals have suggested that activity in early visual cortex is mainly driven by visual input and is well described by a feedforward processing hierarchy. However, evidence from experiments on awake animals has shown that both eye movements and behavioral state can strongly modulate responses of neurons in visual cortex; the functional significance of this modulation, however, remains elusive. Using visual-flow feedback manipulations during locomotion in a virtual reality environment, we found that responses in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex are strongly driven by locomotion and by mismatch between actual and expected visual feedback. These data suggest that processing in visual cortex may be based on predictive coding strategies that use motor-related and visual input to detect mismatches between predicted and actual visual feedback.},

While intracortical inhibition has been implicated as playing a vital role, it has been difficult to observe it clearly. On the basis of recent findings, we propose a model in which the visual cortex brings together a number of different mechanisms for generating orientation-selective responses. Orientation biases in the thalamo-cortical input fibres provide an initial weak selectivity either directly in the excitatory input or by acting via cortical interneurones. This weak selectivity of postsynaptic potentials is then amplified by voltage-sensitive conductances of the cell membrane and excitatory and inhibitory intracortical circuitry, resulting in the sharp tuning seen in the spike discharges of visual cortical cells.},

Recordings were obtained in 12 adult cats during presentation of contours in various orientations. In order to quantitatively evaluate the size of the response area, a method combining both information on the amplitude of the changes and the statistical significance of the changes was proposed. The results showed that the proportion of the cortical area activated reached a peak during the presentation of horizontal or vertical contours, whereas the areas activated by oblique contours were relatively smaller. Cardinal contours (0 degrees and 90 degrees ) activated 50.63 +/- 1.88{\%} (mean +/- SE) of the cortical area in the recording site, whereas oblique contours (45 degrees and 135 degrees ) activated only 45.25 +/- 2.02{\%} of the area. This difference in area was statistically significant (t = 2.38, d.f. = 11, and P {\textless} 0.05). The results demonstrated a difference in the representations of the cardinal and oblique contours in area 18 of the cat visual cortex.},

To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few "strong" but many "weak" excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron.},

abstract = {The design of a macroscope constructed with photography lenses is described and several applications are demonstrated. The macroscope incorporates epi-illumination, a 0.4 numerical aperture, and a 40 mm working distance for imaging wide fields in the range of 1.5-20 mm in diameter. At magnifications of 1X to 2.5X, fluorescence images acquired with the macroscope were 100-700 times brighter than those obtained with commercial microscope objectives at similar magnifications. In several biological applications, the improved light collection efficiency (20-fold, typical) not only minimized bleaching effects, but, in concert with improved illumination throughput (15-fold, typical), significantly enhanced object visibility as well. Reduced phototoxicity and increased signal-to-noise ratios were observed in the in vivo real-time optical imaging of cortical activity using voltage-sensitive dyes. Furthermore, the macroscope has a depth of field which is 5-10 times thinner than that of a conventional low-power microscope. This shallow depth of field has facilitated the imaging of cortical architecture based on activity-dependent intrinsic cortical signals in the living primate brain. In these reflection measurements large artifacts from the surface blood vessels, which were observed with conventional lenses, were eliminated with the macroscope.},

abstract = {A stereotaxic brain atlas of the longtailed macaque (Macaca fascicularis) is presented in a format suitable for use as a template atlas of the macaque brain. It includes most of the brain segmented to show the boundaries of landmark structures such that every point in the brain can be represented by a unique set of coordinates in three-dimensional space and ascribed unambiguously to one and only one primary structure. More than 400 structures are represented, including 360 volumetric structures, which constitute the substance of the brain, and 50 superficial features. To facilitate use with ventriculography, magnetic resonance imaging, and other noninvasive imaging techniques, the stereotaxic space is referenced to internal landmarks, viz., the anterior commissure and posterior commissure; the center of the anterior commissure at the midline is the origin of the stereotaxic axes. Reference of stereotaxis to this bicommissural space facilitates structural comparison with human brain atlases, which are commonly referenced to the biocommissural line. It also facilitates comparison of brains of different nonhuman primate species by providing a template brain against which to compare size and internal variability. Thirty-three coronal sections at 1-mm intervals from the spinomedullary junction to the rostral extreme of the caudate nucleus show most structures of the hindbrain, midbrain, and subcortical forebrain. Separately, four side views and 16 coronal sections show cortical structures. Structures are represented by outlines of their boundaries and labeled according to NeuroNames, a systematic English nomenclature of human and nonhuman primate neuroanatomy. Abbreviations are based on a protocol designed to facilitate cross-species comparisons. Instructions are provided for: (1) locating sites from the Template Atlas in the conventional stereotaxic space of an experimental animal, (2) locating sites identified by conventional stereotaxis in the Template Atlas, and (3) using the Template Atlas to collate, compare, and display image information (e.g., labeled cells, recording sites, stimulation sites, lesions) from multiple animals.},

Although it is true that current distributed theories face challenges in accounting for both neural and behavioral data, the proposed localist account--to the extent that it is articulated at all--runs into more fundamental difficulties. Central to these difficulties is the problem of specifying the set of entities a localist unit represents.},

The premise of my argument is that grandmother cells in neuroscience are the equivalent of localist representations in psychology. When defined in this way, grandmother cells are biologically plausible, given the neuroscience to date. By contrast, the neurophysiology is shown to be inconsistent with the distributed representations often learned in existing parallel distributed processing (PDP) models, and it poses a challenge to PDP theories more generally.},

The experimental session consisted of a 10-min anger induction and a 10-min sadness induction using a relived emotion task; participants were also randomly assigned to an inhibition or noninhibition condition. In addition to subjective ratings of emotional experience provided by participants, their facial behavior was coded using an objective facial affect coding system; a content analysis also was applied to the emotion narratives. Separate repeated measures analyses of variance applied to each emotion domain indicated age differences in the co-occurrence of negative emotions and co-occurrence of positive and negative emotions across domains, thus extending the finding of emotion heterogeneity or complexity in emotion experience to facial behavior and verbal narratives. The authors also found that the inhibition condition resulted in a different pattern of results in the older versus middle-aged and younger adults. The intensity and frequency of discrete emotions were similar across age groups, with a few exceptions. Overall, the findings were generally consistent with differential emotions theory.},

abstract = {The basic laminar organization of excitatory local circuitry in the primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey is similar to that described previously in the cat's visual cortex (Gilbert 1983). This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2-4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional streams.},

abstract = {For over a century, electrical microstimulation has been the most direct method for causally linking brain function with behavior. Despite this long history, it is still unclear how the activity of neural populations is affected by stimulation. For example, there is still no consensus on where activated cells lie or on the extent to which neural processes such as passing axons near the electrode are also activated. Past studies of this question have proven difficult because microstimulation interferes with electrophysiological recordings, which in any case provide only coarse information about the location of activated cells. We used two-photon calcium imaging, an optical method, to circumvent these hurdles. We found that microstimulation sparsely activates neurons around the electrode, sometimes as far as millimeters away, even at low currents. Our results indicate that the pattern of activated neurons likely arises from the direct activation of axons in a volume tens of microns in diameter.},

One simplifying hypothesis that has existed since Cajal is that the neocortex consists of repeated copies of the same fundamental circuit. However, finding that fundamental circuit has proved elusive, although partial drafts of a "canonical circuit" appear in many different guises of structure and function. Here, we review some critical stages in the history of this quest. In doing so, we consider the style of cortical computation in relation to the neuronal machinery that supports it. We conclude that the structure and function of cortex honors two major computational principles: "just-enough" and "just-in-time."},

abstract = {The primary visual cortex of primates and carnivores is organized into columns of neurons with similar preferences for stimulus orientation, but the developmental origin and function of this organization are still matters of debate. We found that the orientation preference of a cortical column is closely related to the population receptive field of its ON and OFF thalamic inputs. The receptive field scatter from the thalamic inputs was more limited than previously thought and matched the average receptive field size of neurons at the input layers of cortex. Moreover, the thalamic population receptive field (calculated as ON - OFF average) had separate ON and OFF subregions, similar to cortical neurons in layer 4, and provided an accurate prediction of the preferred orientation of the column. These results support developmental models of orientation maps that are based on the receptive field arrangement of ON and OFF visual inputs to cortex.},

abstract = {Electrical microstimulation has been used to elucidate cortical function. This review discusses neuronal excitability and effective current spread estimated by using three different methods: 1) single-cell recording, 2) behavioral methods, and 3) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The excitability properties of the stimulated elements in neocortex obtained using these methods were found to be comparable. These properties suggested that microstimulation activates the most excitable elements in cortex, that is, by and large the fibers of the pyramidal cells. Effective current spread within neocortex was found to be greater when measured with fMRI compared with measures based on single-cell recording or behavioral methods. The spread of activity based on behavioral methods is in close agreement with the spread based on the direct activation of neurons (as opposed to those activated synaptically). We argue that the greater activation with imaging is attributed to transynaptic spread, which includes subthreshold activation of sites connected to the site of stimulation. The definition of effective current spread therefore depends on the neural event being measured.},

Several studies of the effect of alcohol on the frontal lobes were identified for review from MedLine, PsychLIT databases and by manual searching. In this review article, the different changes are examined in detail. Computed tomography studies have reported changes of frontal lobe in alcoholism, while magnetic resonance imaging studies supported these findings. Neurophysiological studies with positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography have reported a decreased frontal lobe glucose utilization and reduced cerebral blood flow. There is also evidence from neuropsychological studies that there are specific deficits in alcoholism that suggest frontal lobe dysfunction. Considered together, these studies lend a strong credence to the concept of frontal lobe pathology in alcoholism. However, frontal lobe is not an isolated part of the brain and should be considered with its heavy connections to different cortical and subcortical areas of the brain.},

Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.},

abstract = {1. Many lines of evidence suggest that signals relayed by the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the primate lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) maintain their segregation in cortical processing. We have examined two response properties of units in the striate cortex of macaque monkeys, latency and transience, with the goal of assessing whether they might be used to infer specific geniculate contributions. Recordings were made from 298 isolated units and 1,129 multiunit sites in the striate cortex in four monkeys. Excitotoxin lesions that selectively affected one or the other LGN subdivision were made in three animals to demonstrate directly the magnocellular and parvocellular contributions. An additional 435 single units and 551 multiunit sites were recorded after the ablations. 2. Most units in striate cortex had visual response latencies in the range of 30-50 ms under the stimulus conditions used. The earliest neuronal responses in striate cortex differed appreciably between individuals. The shortest latency recorded in the four animals ranged from 20 to 31 ms. Comparable values were obtained from both single unit and multiunit sites. After lesions were made in the magnocellular subdivision of the LGN in two animals, the shortest response latencies were 7 and 10 ms later than before the ablations. A larger lesion in the parvocellular subdivision of another animal produced no such shift. Thus it appears that the first 7-10 ms of cortical activation can be attributed to activation relayed by the magnocellular layers of the LGN. 3. The units with the shortest latencies were all found in layers 4C or 6 and their responses were among the most transient in striate cortex. Furthermore, their responses all showed a pronounced periodicity at a frequency of 50-100 Hz. This periodicity was stimulus locked, and the responses of all short-latency units oscillated in phase. 4. An index of response transience was computed for the units recorded in striate cortex. The distribution of this index was unimodal and gave no suggestion of distinct contributions from the geniculate subdivisions. Magnocellular and the parvocellular lesions affected the overall transience of responses in striate cortex. The changes, however, were very small; extremely transient responses and extremely sustained responses survived both types of lesions. 5. A characteristic profile was observed in the response latencies in superficial layers. Latencies appeared to increase monotonically from layer 4 toward the surface of cortex, with the most superficial neurons not becoming active until 15 ms after responses were observed in layer 4C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to approximately 2-5 microm. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of {\textless}5{\%}.},

abstract = {Responses of simple and complex cells in cat striate cortex were studied with moving sine-wave gratings before and during application of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide. Both simple and complex cells exhibited a broadening of their spatial frequency tuning functions under bicuculline. This was especially evident at spatial frequencies lower than the ones the cell was responding to before the drug administration. The effects cannot be explained by response saturation and could be reversed by cessation of the iontophoresis. The results indicate that the band-pass response characteristics of the spatial frequency response functions of striate cells derive largely from intracortical inhibition. The findings have implications also for the orientation selectivity of cortical cells. Since many geniculate cells are tuned for stimulus orientation at higher spatial frequencies, suppression of the low-spatial-frequency component would remove some of the orientation non-specific response in striate cortical cells and contribute to their orientation selectivity.},

abstract = {Extrastriate areas TEO and V4 have been associated with form and color vision. Area V4 has also been suggested to participate in processes concerned with attention, stimulus salience, and perceptual learning. In a continuing effort to elucidate the connectional interactions and microcircuitry of these areas, we describe in this report the pattern of feedback connections from TEO and V4. Connections were demonstrated by injections of the high-resolution anterograde tracers PHA-L or biocytin and further analyzed by reconstruction of 25 individual axons through serial sections. This analysis yielded several new results: (1) Both areas TEO and V4 have widespread feedback connections (defined by their preferential termination in layer 1 and avoidance of layer 4). From TEO, there are dense projections to area V4 and moderate ones to V2 and V1. From V4, there are dense projections to V2 and moderate ones to V3 and V1. (2) Terminal fields span large territories in area V1, up to 6.0 mm in the case of axons originating from TEO; up to 5.0 mm in the case of axons originating from V4. In V2, fields tend to be smaller, between 3.0-5.0 mm. (3) Many axons from TEO and some from V4 have terminations in both areas V1 and V2. (4) Because individual terminal clusters and segments are often larger than cytochrome oxidase compartments, especially in V1, we suggest they may not be correlated with this compartmental organization. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that feedback connections may contribute to processes other than perceptual discrimination.},

abstract = {Tree shrew primary visual cortex (V1) exhibits a pronounced laminar segregation of inputs from different classes of relay neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). We examined how several receptive field (RF) properties were transformed from LGN to V1 layer 4 to V1 layer 2/3. The progression of RF properties across these stages differed markedly from that found in the cat. V1 layer 4 cells are largely similar to the the LGN cells that provide their input, being dominated by a single sign (ON or OFF) and being strongly modulated by sinusoidal gratings. Some layer 4 neurons, notably those near the edges of layer 4, exhibited increased orientation selectivity, and most layer 4 neurons exhibited a preference for lower temporal frequencies. Neurons in cortical layer 2/3 differ significantly from those in the LGN; most exhibited strong orientation tuning and both ON and OFF responses. The strength of orientation selectivity exhibited a notable sublaminar organization, with the strongest orientation tuned neurons in the most superficial parts of layer 2/3. Modulation indexes provide evidence for simple and complex cells in both layer 4 and layer 2/3. However, neurons with high modulation indexes were heterogenous in the spatial organization of ON and OFF responses, with many of them exhibiting unbalanced ON and OFF responses rather than well-segregated ON and OFF subunits. When compared to the laminar organization of V1 in other mammals, these data show that the process of natural selection can result in significantly altered structure/function relationships in homologous cortical circuits.},

abstract = {In the visual cortex of higher mammals, neurons are arranged across the cortical surface in an orderly map of preferred stimulus orientations. This map contains 'orientation pinwheels', structures that are arranged like the spokes of a wheel such that orientation changes continuously around a centre. Conventional optical imaging first demonstrated these pinwheels, but the technique lacked the spatial resolution to determine the response properties and arrangement of cells near pinwheel centres. Electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres, but it remained unclear whether they were arranged randomly or in an orderly fashion. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in vivo to determine the microstructure of pinwheel centres in cat visual cortex with single-cell resolution. We find that pinwheel centres are highly ordered: neurons selective to different orientations are clearly segregated even in the very centre. Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the cortical map. This highly ordered arrangement at the level of single cells suggests great precision in the development of cortical circuits underlying orientation selectivity.},

We have now studied the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex of awake mice that were allowed to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed. Most neurons showed more than a doubling of visually evoked firing rate as the animal transitioned from standing still to running, without changes in spontaneous firing or stimulus selectivity. Tuning properties in the awake animal were similar to those measured previously in anesthetized animals. Response magnitude in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not increase with locomotion, demonstrating that the striking change in responsiveness did not result from peripheral effects at the eye. Interestingly, some narrow-spiking cells were spontaneously active during running but suppressed by visual stimuli. These results demonstrate powerful cell-type-specific modulation of visual processing by behavioral state in awake mice.},

How such a robust, high-level representation is achieved by neurons in the human brain is still unclear. In monkeys, neurons in the upper stages of the ventral visual pathway respond to complex images such as faces and objects and show some degree of invariance to metric properties such as the stimulus size, position and viewing angle. We have previously shown that neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) fire selectively to images of faces, animals, objects or scenes. Here we report on a remarkable subset of MTL neurons that are selectively activated by strikingly different pictures of given individuals, landmarks or objects and in some cases even by letter strings with their names. These results suggest an invariant, sparse and explicit code, which might be important in the transformation of complex visual percepts into long-term and more abstract memories.},

abstract = {We have shown previously the existence of small, activity-dependent changes in intrinsic optical properties of cortex that are useful for optical imaging of cortical functional architecture. In this study we introduce a higher resolution optical imaging system that offers spatial and temporal resolution exceeding that achieved by most alternative imaging techniques for imaging cortical functional architecture or for monitoring local changes in cerebral blood volume or oxygen saturation. In addition, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for the activity-dependent intrinsic signals evoked by sensory stimuli, and studied their origins and wavelength dependence. These studies enabled high-resolution visualization of cortical functional architecture at wavelengths ranging from 480 to 940 nm. With the use of near-infrared illumination it was possible to image cortical functional architecture through the intact dura or even through a thinned skull. In addition, the same imaging technique proved useful for imaging and discriminating sensory-evoked, activity-dependent changes in local blood volume and oxygen saturation (oxygen delivery). Illumination at 570 nm allowed imaging of activity-dependent blood volume increases, whereas at 600-630 nm, the predominant signal probably originated from activity-dependent oxygen delivery from capillaries. The onset of oxygen delivery started prior to the blood volume increase. Thus, optical imaging based on intrinsic signals is a minimally invasive procedure for monitoring short- and long-term changes in cerebral activity.},

abstract = {The location, topographic organization, and function of the middle temporal visual area (MT) in the macaque monkey was studied using anatomical and physiological techniques. MT is a small, elliptically shaped area on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be identified by its direct inputs from striate cortex and by its distinctive pattern of heavy myelination. Its average surface area is 33 mm2, which is less than 3{\%} of the size of striate cortex. It contains a complete, topographically organized representation of the contralateral visual hemifield. There are substantial irregularities in the detailed pattern of topographic organization, however, and the representation is significantly more complex than that found for MT in other primates. Much of MT is devoted to the representation of central visual fields, with the emphasis on central vision being similar to that found in striate cortex. Electrophysiological recordings have confirmed previous reports of a high incidence of direction selective cells in MT. The transition in functional properties, from cells lacking direction selectivity outside MT to direction selective cells within, occurs over a distance of 0.1-0.2 mm or less along the lateral border of MT. Such a transition does not occur along the medial border, however, as the cortex medial to MT contains many cells with strong direction selectivity. Nevertheless, this region differs from MT in its myeloarchitecture, its lack of inputs from striate cortex, and the large size of its receptive fields. These results demonstrate the existence of three distinct visual areas on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be distinguished on the basis of both physiological and anatomical criteria.},

abstract = {We live in a multisensory world and one of the challenges the brain is faced with is deciding what information belongs together. Our ability to make assumptions about the relatedness of multisensory stimuli is partly based on their temporal and spatial relationships. Stimuli that are proximal in time and space are likely to be bound together by the brain and ascribed to a common external event. Using this framework we can describe multisensory processes in the context of spatial and temporal filters or windows that compute the probability of the relatedness of stimuli. Whereas numerous studies have examined the characteristics of these multisensory filters in adults and discrepancies in window size have been reported between infants and adults, virtually nothing is known about multisensory temporal processing in childhood. To examine this, we compared the ability of 10 and 11 year olds and adults to detect audiovisual temporal asynchrony. Findings revealed striking and asymmetric age-related differences. Whereas children were able to identify asynchrony as readily as adults when visual stimuli preceded auditory cues, significant group differences were identified at moderately long stimulus onset asynchronies (150-350 ms) where the auditory stimulus was first. Results suggest that changes in audiovisual temporal perception extend beyond the first decade of life. In addition to furthering our understanding of basic multisensory developmental processes, these findings have implications on disorders (e.g., autism, dyslexia) in which emerging evidence suggests alterations in multisensory temporal function.},

abstract = {For over three decades, the mechanism of orientation selectivity of visual cortical neurones has been hotly debated. While intracortical inhibition has been implicated as playing a vital role, it has been difficult to observe it clearly. On the basis of recent findings, we propose a model in which the visual cortex brings together a number of different mechanisms for generating orientation-selective responses. Orientation biases in the thalamo-cortical input fibres provide an initial weak selectivity either directly in the excitatory input or by acting via cortical interneurones. This weak selectivity of postsynaptic potentials is then amplified by voltage-sensitive conductances of the cell membrane and excitatory and inhibitory intracortical circuitry, resulting in the sharp tuning seen in the spike discharges of visual cortical cells.},

abstract = {1. Responses of cat retinal ganglion cells to a drifting sinusoidal grating stimulus were measured as a function of the grating orientation and spatial frequency.2. The response at fixed frequency and contrast varied with orientation in the manner of a cosine function. A new measure was introduced to quantify this orientation bias in the response domain on an absolute scale of 0-100{\%}. Under experimental conditions designed to maximize the effect, the mean bias for 250 cells was 16{\%} and the range was 0-46{\%}. In 70{\%} of cells there was significant bias.3. Orientation bias varied with spatial frequency and was maximal near the high-frequency limit. The majority of biassed cells preferred the same orientation at high and low frequencies but in some cells a reversal occurred: the orientation which gave maximum response at high frequencies gave minimum response at low frequencies. The greatest variation of cut-off frequency with orientation was (2/3) octave.4. Orientation bias was due to neural, not optical, factors. Nevertheless, the phenomenon could often be imitated by deliberately introduced optical astigmatism of up to 4 dioptres for brisk-sustained units and over 10 dioptres for brisk-transient units.5. The grating orientation preferred by cells varied systematically with position in the visual field. The central tendency was for the grating which yielded maximum response to lie parallel to the line joining the cell to the area centralis. This generalization failed for units within 2 degrees of the centre of the area centralis.6. Analysis of orientation bias indicates a functional asymmetry of receptive fields such that the centre mechanism, and sometimes also the surround mechanism, is elongated along the line joining cell to area centralis.},

Siamese cats, and cat deprived of patterned visual experience from birth by monocular lid-suture (MD) were studied. Mathematical techniques designed to analyze direction were used to find the dendritic field orientation of each cell. Statistical techniques designed for angular data were used to determine the relationship between dendritic field orientation and angular position on the retina (polar angle). Our results indicate that 88{\%} of retinal ganglion cells have oriented dendritic fields and that dendritic field orientation is related systematically to retinal position. In all regions of retina more that 0.5 mm from the area centralis the dendritic fields of retinal ganglion cells are oriented radially, i.e., like the spokes of a wheel having the area centralis at its hub. This relationship was present in all animals and cell types studied and was strongest for cells located close to the horizontal meridian (visual streak) of the retina. Retinal ganglion cells appear to be sensitive to stimulus orientation because they have oriented dendritic fields.},

Among the neurones that could be driven monosynaptically from the dLGN, there was a high representation of those with a preference for the primary orientations. This was particularly evident in the case of C (complex) cells. There was no such preponderance of primary orientations among the polysynaptically activated cells. It is proposed that the asymmetry of distribution seen among the first-order cells reflects the asymmetry seen subcortically in neurones that show orientation biases. It may be that the cortex elaborates a more uniform representation of orientations only at the higher ordinal levels.},

abstract = {People with whom one is personally acquainted tend to elicit richer and more vivid memories than people with whom one does not have a personal connection. Recent findings from neurons in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) have shown that individual cells respond selectively and invariantly to representations of famous people [Quian Quiroga R, Reddy L, Kreiman G, Koch C, Fried I (2005) Nature 435(7045):1102-1107]. Observing these cells, we wondered whether photographs of personally relevant individuals, such as family members, might be more likely to generate such responses. To address this issue, we recorded the activity of 2,330 neurons in the human MTL while patients viewed photographs of varying personal relevance: previously unknown faces and landscapes, familiar but not necessarily personally relevant faces and landscapes, and finally, photographs of the patients themselves, their families, and the experimenters. Our findings indicate that personally relevant photographs are indeed more likely to elicit selective responses in MTL neurons than photographs of individuals with whom the patients have had no personal contact. These findings further suggest that relevant stimuli are encoded by a larger proportion of neurons than less relevant stimuli, given that familiar or personally relevant items are linked to a larger variety of experiences and memories of these experiences.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine what contributions are made to the rat full-field electroretinogram (ERG) by ganglion cells (GCs). To that end, the ERG was assessed longitudinally following optic nerve transection (ONTx). Additional studies were conducted using intravitreal injections of pharmacologically active substances. The ERG was recorded simultaneously from both eyes of anaesthetized adult Brown-Norway rats (ketamine: xylazine: acepromazine, 55: 5: 1 mg kg(-1)) using custom silver chloride electrodes. Stimuli were brief, white xenon discharges delivered via a Ganzfeld under dark-adapted and light-adapted conditions (150 cd m(-2)). ERGs were obtained 1, 2, 3, 4 and 9 weeks after ONTx (n = 8) or sham (n = 8) operations. ONTx reduced both positive and negative components of the scotopic threshold response (pSTR and nSTR). Scotopic ERG responses to brighter flashes, including a-waves, b-waves and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were unaffected by ONTx. ONTx reduced the photopic b-wave and OPs. TTX (6 microM) reduced the pSTR and nSTR, but not the scotopic a-wave, b-wave or OPs. TTX had dramatic effects on the photopic ERG, surpassing the effects of ONTx. TTX application 9 weeks post-ONTx had little additional effect on the STR. Inhibition of inner retinal responses using GABA (10 mM) or NMDA (0.8 mM) reduced the nSTR substantially. Similar results were obtained with antagonists of AMPA/KA ionotropic glutamate receptors 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (CNQX, 0.2 mM) or cis-2,3-piperidinedicarboxylic acid (PDA, 5 mm); however, both also reduced the scotopic b-wave by approximately 40 {\%}. By contrast, the NMDA receptor antagonist D(-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (D-AP7, 0.2 mM) had no effect alone, but the combination of D-AP7 and CNQX completely abolished the STR. The results of this study indicate that: (1) both pSTR and nSTR components in the rat depend directly upon intact GC responses, and that amacrine cell contributions to these components are relatively small; (2) scotopic ERG response components to brighter flashes receive little influence from GCs; (3) the rat photopic ERG also reflects GC signals and may serve as an additional useful test of GC function; (4) TTX had dramatic effects on the rat photopic ERG that were not attributable to GC currents, but rather to voltage-gated sodium currents in amacrine or interplexiform cells; (5) a small residual negative STR persisted after ONTx that was likely to be generated by graded responses of third-order retinal cells, most likely amacrine cells.},

abstract = {A fundamental claim associated with parallel distributed processing (PDP) theories of cognition is that knowledge is coded in a distributed manner in mind and brain. This approach rejects the claim that knowledge is coded in a localist fashion, with words, objects, and simple concepts (e.g. "dog"), that is, coded with their own dedicated representations. One of the putative advantages of this approach is that the theories are biologically plausible. Indeed, advocates of the PDP approach often highlight the close parallels between distributed representations learned in connectionist models and neural coding in brain and often dismiss localist (grandmother cell) theories as biologically implausible. The author reviews a range a data that strongly challenge this claim and shows that localist models provide a better account of single-cell recording studies. The author also contrast local and alternative distributed coding schemes (sparse and coarse coding) and argues that common rejection of grandmother cell theories in neuroscience is due to a misunderstanding about how localist models behave. The author concludes that the localist representations embedded in theories of perception and cognition are consistent with neuroscience; biology only calls into question the distributed representations often learned in PDP models.},

abstract = {To understand the transmission of sensory signals in visual pathways we studied the morphology and central projection of ganglion cell populations in marmoset monkeys. Retinal ganglion cells were labeled by photofilling following injections of retrograde tracer in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), or by intracellular injection with neurobiotin. Ganglion cell morphology was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis. In addition to midget and parasol ganglion cells, this method distinguished three main clusters of wide-field cells that correspond to small bistratified, sparse, and broad thorny cells identified previously. The small bistratified and sparse cells occupy neighboring positions on the hierarchical (linkage distance) tree. These cell types are presumed to carry signals originating in short-wavelength sensitive (S or "blue") cones in the retina. The linkage distance from these putative S-cone pathway ganglion cells to other wide-field cells is similar to the linkage distance from midget cells to parasol cells, suggesting that S-cone cells form a distinct functional subgroup of ganglion cells. Small bistratified cells and large sparse cells were the most commonly labeled wide-field cells following LGN injections in koniocellular layer K3. This is consistent with physiological evidence that the role of this layer includes transmission of S-cone signals to the visual cortex. Other wide-field cell types were also labeled following injections including K3, and other koniocellular LGN layers; these cell types may correspond to "non-blue koniocellular" receptive fields recorded in physiological studies.},

abstract = {Some theories suggest that spontaneously activated, drug-related associations in memory may have a "freer reign" in predicting drug use among individuals with lower working memory capacity. This study evaluated this hypothesis among 145 at-risk youth attending continuation high schools (CHS). This is the 1st study to evaluate this type of dual-process interaction in the prediction of drug use among a sample of at-risk adolescents. The CHS students completed assessments of drug-related memory associations, working memory capacity, and drug use. Control variables included age, gender, ethnicity, and acculturation. Robust multiple regression using least trimmed squares estimation indicated that there was a significant linear by linear interaction between working memory capacity (assessed with the self-ordered pointing task) and drug-related associations (assessed with verb generation and cue-behavior association tasks) in the prediction of alcohol and cigarette use. Consistent with dual-process cognitive theories, drug-related associations in memory predicted drug use more strongly in students with lower levels of working memory capacity. These findings add to the literature implicating the influence of dual cognitive processes in adolescent risk behaviors.},

abstract = {Light-evoked changes in pigment epithelial cell membrane potentials and retinal extracellular potassium ion concentration, [K+]0, were measured in an in vitro frog retina-pigment epithelium-choroid preparation. Light stimuli hyperpolarized the apical membrane of the pigment epithelium. Through an electrical shunt pathway connecting the apical and basal membranes, the basal membrane also hyperpolarized, but to a lesser degree than the apical membrane. This differential hyperpolariation of the two membranes increased the transepithelial potential (TEP). This increase in TEP was shown to be the major voltage source of the c-wave of the electroretinogram (ERG). Direct measurement of [K+]0 in the distal retina, made with K+-specific microelectrodes, showed a light-evoked decrease in [K+]0 having an identical time course to the apical hyperpolarization. There was a linear relationship between the light-evoked change in TEP and the logarithm of [K+]0. This exact relationship was also found when the apical membrane was perfused directly with solutions of varying [K+]0. The change in TEP associated with the ERC c-wave, therefore, was explained solely by the response of the pigment epithelium to the light-evoked decrease in [K+]0 in the distal retina.},

@article{Desimone1985b,
abstract = {The corticocortical pathway from striate cortex into the temporal lobe plays a crucial role in the visual recognition of objects. Anatomical studies indicate that this pathway is mainly organized as a serial hierarchy of multiple visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, V4, and inferior temporal cortex (IT). As expected from the anatomy, we have found that neurons in V4 and IT, like those in V1 and V2, are sensitive to many kinds of information relevant to object recognition. In the spatial domain, many V4 cells exhibit length, width, orientation, direction of motion and spatial frequency selectivity. In the spectral domain, many V4 cells are also tuned to wavelength. Thus, V4 is not specialized to analyze one particular attribute of a visual stimulus; rather, V4 appears to process both spatial and spectral information in parallel. A special contribution of V4 neurons to visual processing may lie in specific spatial and spectral interactions between their small excitatory receptive fields and large silent suppressive surrounds. Thus, although the excitatory receptive fields of V4 neurons are small, the responses of V4 neurons are influenced by stimuli throughout a much larger portion of the visual field. In IT, neurons also appear to process both spatial and spectral information throughout a large portion of the visual field. However, unlike V4 neurons, the excitatory receptive fields of IT neurons are very large. Many IT neurons, for example, are selective for the overall shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, anywhere within the central visual field. Together, these results suggest that within the areas of the occipito-temporal pathway, many different stimulus qualities are processed in parallel, but the type of analysis may become more global at each stage of processing.},

abstract = {Electrical microstimulation has been used to elucidate cortical function. This review discusses neuronal excitability and effective current spread estimated by using three different methods: 1) single-cell recording, 2) behavioral methods, and 3) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The excitability properties of the stimulated elements in neocortex obtained using these methods were found to be comparable. These properties suggested that microstimulation activates the most excitable elements in cortex, that is, by and large the fibers of the pyramidal cells. Effective current spread within neocortex was found to be greater when measured with fMRI compared with measures based on single-cell recording or behavioral methods. The spread of activity based on behavioral methods is in close agreement with the spread based on the direct activation of neurons (as opposed to those activated synaptically). We argue that the greater activation with imaging is attributed to transynaptic spread, which includes subthreshold activation of sites connected to the site of stimulation. The definition of effective current spread therefore depends on the neural event being measured.},

abstract = {Although orientation columns are less than a millimeter in width, recent neuroimaging studies indicate that viewed orientations can be decoded from cortical activity patterns sampled at relatively coarse resolutions of several millimeters. One proposal is that these differential signals arise from random spatial irregularities in the columnar map. However, direct support for this hypothesis has yet to be obtained. Here, we used high-field, high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and multivariate pattern analysis to determine the spatial scales at which orientation-selective information can be found in the primary visual cortex (V1) of cats and humans. We applied a multiscale pattern analysis approach in which fine- and coarse-scale signals were first removed by ideal spatial lowpass and highpass filters, and the residual activity patterns then analyzed by linear classifiers. Cat visual cortex, imaged at 0.3125 mm resolution, showed a strong orientation signal at the scale of individual columns. Nonetheless, reliable orientation bias could still be found at spatial scales of several millimeters. In the human visual cortex, imaged at 1 mm resolution, a majority of orientation information was found on scales of millimeters, with small contributions from global spatial biases exceeding approximately 1 cm. Our high-resolution imaging results demonstrate a reliable millimeters-scale orientation signal, likely emerging from irregular spatial arrangements of orientation columns and their supporting vasculature. fMRI pattern analysis methods are thus likely to be sensitive to signals originating from other irregular columnar structures elsewhere in the brain.},

abstract = {Neurons in the cerebral cortex are organized into anatomical columns, with ensembles of cells arranged from the surface to the white matter. Within a column, neurons often share functional properties, such as selectivity for stimulus orientation; columns with distinct properties, such as different preferred orientations, tile the cortical surface in orderly patterns. This functional architecture was discovered with the relatively sparse sampling of microelectrode recordings. Optical imaging of membrane voltage or metabolic activity elucidated the overall geometry of functional maps, but is averaged over many cells (resolution {\textgreater}100 microm). Consequently, the purity of functional domains and the precision of the borders between them could not be resolved. Here, we labelled thousands of neurons of the visual cortex with a calcium-sensitive indicator in vivo. We then imaged the activity of neuronal populations at single-cell resolution with two-photon microscopy up to a depth of 400 microm. In rat primary visual cortex, neurons had robust orientation selectivity but there was no discernible local structure; neighbouring neurons often responded to different orientations. In area 18 of cat visual cortex, functional maps were organized at a fine scale. Neurons with opposite preferences for stimulus direction were segregated with extraordinary spatial precision in three dimensions, with columnar borders one to two cells wide. These results indicate that cortical maps can be built with single-cell precision.},

abstract = {Afferent feedback from muscles and skin has been suggested to influence our emotions during the control of facial expressions. Recent imaging studies have shown that imitation of facial expressions is associated with activation in limbic regions such as the amygdala. Yet, the physiological interaction between this limbic activation and facial feedback remains unclear. To study if facial feedback effects on limbic brain responses during intentional imitation of facial expressions, we applied botulinum toxin (BTX)-induced denervation of frown muscles in combination with functional magnetic resonance imaging as a reversible lesion model to minimize the occurrence of afferent muscular and cutaneous input. We show that, during imitation of angry facial expressions, reduced feedback due to BTX treatment attenuates activation of the left amygdala and its functional coupling with brain stem regions implicated in autonomic manifestations of emotional states. These findings demonstrate that facial feedback modulates neural activity within central circuitries of emotion during intentional imitation of facial expressions. Given that people tend to mimic the emotional expressions of others, this could provide a potential physiological basis for the social transfer of emotion.},

Similarly, the inhibitory neurons show characteristic morphology and patterns of connections throughout the neocortex. We offer a simple model of cortical processing that is consistent with the major features of cortical circuits: The superficial layer neurons within local patches of cortex, and within areas, cooperate to explore all possible interpretations of different cortical input and cooperatively select an interpretation consistent with their various cortical and subcortical inputs.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that sensitivity to different stimulus orientations is mapped in a globally equivalent fashion across primate visual cortex, at a spatial scale larger than that of orientation columns. However, some evidence predicts instead that radial orientations should produce higher activity than other orientations, throughout visual cortex. Here, this radial orientation bias was robustly confirmed using (1) human psychophysics, plus fMRI in (2) humans and (3) behaving monkeys. In visual cortex, fMRI activity was at least 20{\%} higher in the retinotopic representations of polar angle which corresponded to the radial stimulus orientations (relative to tangential). In a global demonstration of this, we activated complementary retinotopic quadrants of visual cortex by simply changing stimulus orientation, without changing stimulus location in the visual field. This evidence reveals a neural link between orientation sensitivity and the cortical retinotopy, which have previously been considered independent.},

abstract = {Orientation selectivity is a property of mammalian primary visual cortex (V1) neurons, yet its emergence along the visual pathway varies across species. In carnivores and primates, elongated receptive fields first appear in V1, whereas in lagomorphs such receptive fields emerge earlier, in the retina. Here we examine the mouse visual pathway and reveal the existence of orientation selectivity in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) relay cells. Cortical inactivation does not reduce this orientation selectivity, indicating that cortical feedback is not its source. Orientation selectivity is similar for LGN relay cells spiking and subthreshold input to V1 neurons, suggesting that cortical orientation selectivity is inherited from the LGN in mouse. In contrast, orientation selectivity of cat LGN relay cells is small relative to subthreshold inputs onto V1 simple cells. Together, these differences show that although orientation selectivity exists in visual neurons of both rodents and carnivores, its emergence along the visual pathway, and thus its underlying neuronal circuitry, is fundamentally different.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to explore the functional organization of direction of motion in cat area 18. Optical imaging was used to record the activity of populations of neurons. We found a patchy distribution of cortical regions exhibiting preference for one direction over the opposite direction of motion. The degree of clustering according to preference of direction was two to four times smaller than that observed for orientation. In general, direction preference changed smoothly along the cortical surface; however, discontinuities in the direction maps were observed. These discontinuities formed lines that separated pairs of patches with preference for opposite directions. The functional maps for direction and for orientation preference were closely related; typically, an iso-orientation patch was divided into regions that exhibited preference for opposite directions, orthogonal to the orientation. In addition, the lines of discontinuity within the direction map often connected points of singularity in the orientation map. Although the organization of both domains was related, the direction and the orientation selective responses were separable; whereas the selective response according to direction of motion was nearly independent of the length of bars used for visual stimulation, the selective response to orientation decreased significantly with decreasing length of the bars. Extensive single and multiunit electrical recordings, targeted to selected domains of the functional maps, confirmed the features revealed by optical imaging. We conclude that significant processing of direction of motion is performed early in the cat visual pathway.},

All children had a comprehensive eye examination, including cycloplegic (cyclopentolate 1{\%}) autorefraction and ocular biometry. Hyperopia was defined as a right spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of ≥+2.00 diopters (D), myopia as ≤-0.50 D, and astigmatism as a cylindrical error of ≥1.00 D. Results. The mean SER was similar at age 6 to 7 years (P = 0.9); however, at 12 to 13 years, children in Northern Ireland had a significantly less hyperopic mean SER (+0.66 D) than children in Sydney (+0.83 D, P = 0.008). The prevalence of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism was significantly greater in Northern Ireland than Sydney at both ages (all P {\textless} 0.03). The distribution of refraction was highly leptokurtic in both samples, but less so in Northern Ireland (kurtosis: 6-7 years of age, 7.2; 12-13 years of age, 5.9) than Sydney (kurtosis: 6-7 years of age, 15.0; 12-13 years of age, 19.5). Conclusions. European Caucasian children in Northern Ireland have a greater prevalence of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism when compared to children living in Sydney. Risk factors for myopia such as parental myopia, parental education, and educational standards do not appear to explain the differences. Further work on levels of near work and time spent outdoors is required.},

abstract = {The flash electroretinogram (ERG) represents a serial ensemble of neural responses that can be used to objectively evaluate retinal function on a layer-by-layer basis. In this review, the seminal concepts of Granit are developed within the modern context to demonstrate how the ERG waveform can be decomposed to isolate the activity of individual neural populations and their circuitry. The contribution of rods and cones to the ERG waveform can be precisely defined with simple methods that yield the veridical cone response, which allows identification of rod-isolated components. This knowledge will afford an enhanced capacity to understand retinal development and ageing as well as to interpret the effects of insult, genetic manipulation and disease processes on photoreceptor and neuron-specific components. This review integrates conclusions drawn from a large body of past work and presents new data that enables the provision of detailed methodology for ERG assessment in rodents. Emphasis is placed on protocols that allow efficient acquisition of useful information for the major ERG components with minimal complexity. In particular, specific guidelines for the isolation of rod and cone contributions from the full-field ERG in rodents are provided. This is complemented with detailed and novel methodology for determining parameters that describe individual neuronal generators of rod and cone responses. The effect of stimulus energy on the kinetics of ERG response recovery and photopigment bleaching and regeneration are also discussed. The guidelines presented here are applicable to a wide range of investigations of retinal disease in rodent models.},

In primates, feedforward projections from the retina to the LGN and from the LGN to primary visual cortex are organized into anatomically and physiologically distinct parallel pathways. Recent work demonstrates a close relationship between these parallel streams of feedforward projections and the corticogeniculate feedback pathway. Here, we review the evidence for stream-specific feedback in the primate and consider the implications of parallel streams of feedback for vision.},

abstract = {Mechanisms underlying direction selectivity were studied in V1 of alert fixating macaque monkeys. Some direction-selective cells showed delayed asymmetric inhibition, some showed a shifting excitatory time course across the receptive field, and some showed both. Both the direction of the spatial offset of the inhibition and the direction of the shift in excitatory response time course correlated with the cells' preferred directionality. The delayed asymmetric inhibition may contribute to the shifting response time course. The data suggest that asymmetric inhibition is the major determinant for directionality in these cells, though both mechanisms could contribute. Based on this physiology, a simple, single-cell model is proposed, consistent with the known anatomy of some direction-selective cells.},

abstract = {The relationships between cytochrome oxidase blobs, ocular-dominance columns, and iso-orientation domains, subsystems underlying visual perception, were explored in primary visual cortex of macaque monkey. High-resolution maps of these three subsystems were acquired. Optical imaging based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals revealed that the most prominent organizational feature of orientation preference was a radial arrangement, forming a pinwheel-like structure surrounding a singularity point. More than 80{\%} of these pinwheels were centered along the midline of ocular-dominance columns. The iso-orientation contours of adjacent pinwheels crossed borders of ocular-dominance columns at approximately right angles. Pinwheels with the same or opposite directions of orientation-preference change were smoothly connected with each other. On the average, all orientations were equally represented. In exactly the same cortical area, the cytochrome oxidase blobs, thought to be involved in color processing, were also mapped, using cytochrome oxidase histology. Like the centers of pinwheels, the centers of blobs also lie along the midline of ocular-dominance columns. However, the centers of pinwheels did not coincide with the centers of blobs; these two subsystems are spatially independent. "Hypercolumn" modules, each including two complete pinwheels in two adjacent columns of complementary ocularity, as well as portions of a few blobs, were frequently found but did not seem to be the primary unit of cortical organization. An alternative to hypercolumns is proposed.},

Similarly, the inhibitory neurons show characteristic morphology and patterns of connections throughout the neocortex. We offer a simple model of cortical processing that is consistent with the major features of cortical circuits: The superficial layer neurons within local patches of cortex, and within areas, cooperate to explore all possible interpretations of different cortical input and cooperatively select an interpretation consistent with their various cortical and subcortical inputs.},

Previous anatomical and imaging studies have shown that although the exact layouts of these orientation preference maps vary between individuals, features of iso-orientation domains such as width and spacing appear constant within a species. Using chronic optical imaging of intrinsic signals we now demonstrate that in ferret area 17 a larger proportion of cortical surface is dominated by responses to horizontal and vertical contours than to the two oblique orientations. This was true for all ferrets studied both during development and in adulthood. Interestingly, however, we found that the degree of the overrepresentation varied significantly between individual animals. In some young ferrets, responses to horizontal and vertical stimuli developed faster than responses to oblique stimuli, and a much larger percentage of the cortex responded preferentially to horizontal and vertical stimuli. In other individuals, responses to all stimuli developed at roughly the same rate, and there was relatively little overrepresentation of horizontal and vertical preferences.},

In trials where attention is directed elsewhere, responses to the same stimuli were significantly reduced. In some cells the early response component was not modulated by attention, but later components were affected by the locus of attention.
