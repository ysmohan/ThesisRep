(a-c) show the two-dimensional profiles of the receptive fields. (d-f) show the spatial frequency tuning of the cells on a linear scale. The tuning bandwidth thus obtained is the absolute bandwidth. (g-i) shows the same data in (d-f) on a logarithmic scale. The bandwidth thus obtained is similar to the relative bandwdth. The top two rows indicate a patch by patch fourier analysis system. The relationship of the absolute and relative bandwidths of the neurons in this system are shown in j). The bottom two rows suggest an alternate scheme where the neurons have a constant number of sub-regions. The relationship between the absolute and relative bandwidths of the cells in this system are shown in (k).}}{111}}

The spatially segregated RF of the simple cells is translated into the temporally segregated response of the neuron. Whereas, in the complex cell, the overlapping sub-regions are reflected in the temporally overlapping response of the neuron. Accordingly, the simple cell has a high SI (0.92) and the complex cell has a lower SI (0.39).}}{117}}
