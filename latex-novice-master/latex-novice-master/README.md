## LaTeX for Theses and Journal Articles

LaTeX is a free, cross-platform document markup language that aims to satisfy
three requirements:

* Beautiful typesetting, particularly of specialised notation;
* Remove cosmetic distractions so that an author can focus on structure and content;
* Graceful handling of large, complicated projects.

By the end of this workshop,
you'll have covered most aspects of simple LaTeX usage,
such that you'll be able to use it for article and thesis writing.
